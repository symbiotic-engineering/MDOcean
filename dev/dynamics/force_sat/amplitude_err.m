% notebook p113 2/7/25
% this is the amplitude ratio assuming zeta and wn vs freq are const
% I would need to combine this with the wave spectrum to get % energy accounted for
% and technically also combine with zeta and wn vs freq and excitation force vs freq

syms a positive
syms b real
syms n integer positive
trm = 1/ sqrt( a*(1+2*n)^4 + b*(1+2*n)^2 + 1);
s = symsum(trm,n,1,Inf);
simplify(s,'Steps',100)
