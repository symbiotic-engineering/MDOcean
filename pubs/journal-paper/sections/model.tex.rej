 The dynamics module requires iteration to incorporate nonlinearities into the quasi-linear frequency domain model, shown in the XDSM diagram as the orange box.
 The dynamics iteration occurs separately for each outer iteration of the optimizer.
 This structure is known as the multiple discipline feasible (MDF) architecture.
-In principle, it is possible to remove the dynamics iteration and instead incorporate the nonlinear dynamics as a residual constraint within the optimization, which is known as the simultaneous analysis and design (SAND) architecture \cite{martins_multidisciplinary_2013}.
+In principle, it is possible to remove the dynamics iteration and instead incorporate the nonlinear dynamics as a residual equality constraint within the optimization, which is known as the simultaneous analysis and design (SAND) architecture \cite{martins_multidisciplinary_2013}.
+SAND generally decreases the runtime of the simulation (analysis) but requires more optimization iterations, since it is the optimization rather than the simulation that must converge residuals. 
 The WecOptTool control co-optimization software pursues the SAND strategy by collocating the dynamics constraints with the pseudo-spectral method \cite{coe_initial_2020}.
-In MDOcean, SAND would decrease the runtime of a single simulation but would likely require more optimization iterations and invites the possibility of inconsistent dynamics if the optimization terminates unsuccessfully \cite{martins_multidisciplinary_2013}.
-Since the hydrodynamics module, not dynamics and controls, is the dominant computational cost of the simulation, MDF is chosen to avoid the additional hydrodynamics evaluations that SAND would require.

+Readers familiar with trajectory optimization should note that the choice of MDF versus SAND as an MDO architecture parallels that of shooting versus collocation as a transcription method, in the sense that one chooses to enforce governing equations with simulation versus optimization \cite{underactuated}.
+However, in MDO the appropriate decision depends on characteristics of all modules, not merely the module whose governing equations are in question.
+As \sectionautorefname~\ref{sec:sim-runtime} will demonstrate, the hydrodynamics module, not dynamics and controls, is the dominant computational cost of the simulation.
+This means that even a substantial dynamics speedup represents only a small speedup of the full simulation and is unlikely to outweigh the slowdown of more (hydrodynamics) simulation evaluations.
+For this reason, SAND would likely increase the runtime of the full optimization, motivating MDOcean's selection of MDF as the more suitable architecture.
+Another advantage of MDF over SAND is that the latter invites the possibility of inconsistent dynamics if the optimization terminates unsuccessfully \cite{martins_multidisciplinary_2013} and requires optimizing a dummy constant objective to perform simulation without optimization.
