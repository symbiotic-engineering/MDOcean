\section{Optimization Methodology}\label{sec:optim-methods}
The methodology is iterative and consists of four main components:
(1) decide the simulation structure,
(2) implement and verify appropriate models for each simulation module,
(3) formally define the optimization problem formulation, and
(4) outline a process for solving the optimization problem and analyzing the results.
Figure~\ref{fig:overview-methods} depicts this methodology visually.

\subsection{Simulation Structure}
The optimization uses a simulation model known as MDOcean, a purpose-developed open-source MATLAB package for fast and accurate semi-analytical WEC modeling.

\subsection{Modeling Approach}
This section provides an overview of the modeling approach, while readers are referred to reference \cite{mccabe_development_2025} for the full assumptions and validation of the model.
