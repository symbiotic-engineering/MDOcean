\section*{Abstract}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Wave energy converter (WEC) design optimization has traditionally focused on minimizing the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) or similar proxies. However, this approach overlooks the realistic drivers of energy system planning, where capacity installation decisions are made to minimize the overall system cost. Grid system cost does not necessarily align with LCOE due to the complex temporal and spatial relationship between energy generation and grid demand. Additionally, conventional WEC optimization neglects broader electrification goals, where the reduction of lifetime equivalent carbon dioxide emissions is the key driver of climate change mitigation.

To bridge this gap, the authors previously proposed a system-level techno-economic and environmental WEC optimization framework that integrates capacity expansion modeling (CEM) and life cycle analysis (LCA) into the design objective. This approach provides a more comprehensive assessment of wave energyâ€™s net value proposition beyond conventional cost metrics.

In this work, we implement this methodology within a new open-source multidisciplinary design optimization framework. Our implementation leverages the GenX CEM, the PowerGenome energy data interface, the Idemat LCA dataset, and the MDOcean wave energy converter model. A surrogate model of the CEM reduces computation time compared to the naive CEM-in-the-loop approach. We present preliminary optimization results for the Reference Model 3 (RM3) WEC, demonstrating the impact of optimizing for new value-driven economic and environmental system metrics compared to the standard LCOE.

For the scope of emissions controllable in the early device design phase, the environmental objective aligns well with the economic one, indicating that design-for-environment techniques may not be relevant until later in the design process. Meanwhile, the grid system economic objective is hypothesized to favor larger WECs in scenarios with winter generation deficits, such as the U.S. northeast with electrified heat loads, where the value of capturing energetic winter sea states outweighs the cost of surviving them. On the other hand, systems with storage constraints should favor smaller WECs, where the avoided storage cost due to more consistent power generation outweighs the penalty in absorbed power. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of these findings for future WEC design optimization priorities.

Some real words.

    \caption{Surrogate model diagram}
    \label{fig:surrogate}
\end{wrapfigure}

\subsubsection{MDOcean}

    -  cost
    -  power
    -  quick mention hydro, structures, amplitude limits, force saturation
\lipsum[1]

\subsubsection{Capacity Expansion Model (CEM)}

    -  power genome
    -  GenX: equation~\eqref{eq:CEM-objective} for the LP it solves, what assumptions it makes (equilibrium)

\begin{equation}\label{eq:CEM-objective}
    \min_{x_{grid}} C_{grid} = \sum_{gen} \sum_{t} p_{gen,t} x_{grid,gen,t}
\end{equation}

    -  time domain reduction and what timescales of power variation and demand alignment are captured vs relevant (seasonality, storms, within wave, within sea state between waves)
    -  Do we use any warm start fanciness for the LP
    -  scenarios / State of the world sweeps
    -  choice of spatial and temporal resolution and scope
    -  Emissions in CEM
    -  how we're confident enough that the results aren't due to random chance alignment between that day's demand and wave data and are real / significant

\subsubsection{Surrogate model to link CEM with design}
$C$ refers to costs (\$M) (output from CEM), $S$ refers to specific capacity costs (\$M/kW) (input to CEM), $x_{grid}$ refers to installed capacities (decision variable in CEM), and $E$ refers to specific energy costs (\$/kWh). The amount of built wave capacity $x_{grid,WEC}$ is not to be confused with $x_{design}$, the WEC design variables in the outer (MDOcean) optimization that are parameters (held constant) in the CEM.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    C_{grid}(p_{grid},x_{design}) &= C_{grid,0}(p_{grid})- \beta_1(p_{grid})~ x_{grid,WEC}(p_{grid},x_{design}) \\
    \frac{x_{grid,WEC}(p_{grid},x_{design})}{x_{grid,WEC}(p_{grid},x_{design})+\sum_{gen\neq WEC}x_{grid,gen}(p_{grid},x_{design})} &= \min\left(\beta_2(p_{grid}) \times \max\left(\frac{S_{WEC,thresh}(p_{grid},x_{design})}{S_{WEC}(x_{design})}-1,0\right), 1\right) \\
    S_{WEC,thresh}(p_{grid},x_{design}) &= S_{max,thresh}(p_{grid}) - \beta_3(p_{grid}) \zeta(x_{design}) - \beta_4(p_{grid}) \frac{\omega_n}{\omega_p}(x_{design}) - \beta_5(p_{grid}) \min\left(\frac{P_{max}}{P_{pk}}(x_{design}),1\right) \\
    \sum_{gen\neq WEC}x_{grid,gen}(p_{grid},x_{design}) &= \sum_{gen}x_{grid,gen,0}(p_{grid})-\beta_6(p_{grid}) \zeta(x_{design}) - \beta_7(p_{grid}) \frac{\omega_n}{\omega_p}(x_{design}) - \beta_8(p_{grid}) \min\left(\frac{P_{max}}{P_{pk}}(x_{design}),1\right)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

%improvements to make to above eqn:
%- debatable whether coeffs should be kept dimensional, ie should $\beta_1$ get divided by total capacity and $C_{grid,0}(p_{grid})$ so it's relating percent cost to percent capacity?
%- $\beta_{3-8}$ terms could be made nonlinear as needed - ie $(\frac{\omega_n}{\omega_p})^2-1$ shows up in theory. I could also try to feed-forward incorporate the time domain power reconstruction, ie a peak to average ratio, if that is looking like a better fit than the freq domain stuff, but that just tells me that my hope of doing freq domain to connect to mdocean won't work out.
%- ideally some of these betas turn out to be independent of p grid, which means more of the p grid dependence can be found just from the 0 (no wec) case for that p, without requiring a whole design sweep. That is the reason all this modeling is potentially more useful than a lookup table.
%- Could add saturation to make sure $S_{WEC,thresh}>0$ and $C_{grid}>0$.
%- add hats or some other notation to differentiate predicted (fit) from actual

    -  idea of doing a bode fit and why it captures the right info
    -  Details of 2nd order system bode fit (equation~\eqref{eq:bode-fit}), figure

\begin{equation}\label{eq:bode-fit}
\begin{aligned}
    \zeta,\omega_n &= \mathrm{argmin}\left( \epsilon_{mag}^2 + \epsilon_{phase}^2 \right) \\
    \epsilon_{mag} &= xxx \\
    \epsilon_{phase} &= xxx
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
    
    -  discussion on implication of bode fit: neglects change in $\zeta$ and $\omega_n$ with $H_s$, and assumes that the WEC can generate less than its max power without violating any amplitude/force constraints        
    -  how CEM system cost gets turned into NVOE metric (since CEM enforces NVOE=0)

    -  LCA items modeled but not changed in this optim: distance from shore
    -  LCA items not considered: fish, hydraulic fluid, detail design
    -  LCA table with weights
    -  If you express net eco value as a weighted sum of steel volume and surface area, how similar are the coeffs to the coeffs for cost?

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ lll } 
     \hline
     Material/component & Eco-cost & Unit \\

\section{Results}
    -  CEM sweep (no optim) raw vs fitted
    -  single obj optim (min NVOE compared to min LCOE)
    -  multi obj optim (pareto NVOE vs net eco value per power)
    -  runtime info
    -  when WECs are viable, what are they replacing (batteries or wind or solar etc)? Find by looking at how does the optimal LP output change with
    -  can the CEM results be predicted by correlation coefficient of WEC power with demand or with energy storage or with lost load of solar, the capacity factor, sum of hourly profit, other proxies?
