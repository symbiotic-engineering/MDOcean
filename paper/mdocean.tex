%% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
%% Text of abstract
Wave energy converters (WECs) can advance the global energy transition by producing clean power for utility grids and offshore technologies. Considering many disciplines concurrently in an optimization process can allow WEC designers to systematically explore interdisciplinary tradeoffs, more fully capture the breadth of design considerations, and leverage coupling for system-wide benefit. This paper applies the multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) methodology to perform single- and multi-objective gradient-based optimization of the Reference Model 3 (RM3), a two-body point absorber WEC design benchmark. Five hull dimensions, five structural thicknesses, and the generator force and power rating are simultaneously optimized while obeying various static, dynamic, and structural failure constraints. Objectives include the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), power production, and capital cost. MDO principles motivate the optimization formulation and solution process.

The optimization's large scope and comprehensive nature are uniquely possible due to the purpose-developed semi-analytical model used for simulation. The model incorporates a mesh-free eigenfunction-based linear hydrodynamic solver, a quasi-linearized dynamics engine that handles drag and saturation nonlinearities in the frequency-domain, a structural sizing module with realistic yield/ultimate/buckling failure criteria for storm and fatigue design load cases, and a simple cost estimator to assess techno-economic viability. The text documents the derivation, assumptions, and optimization implications of the model, which is called MDOcean and released open-source. Validation and computational benchmarking demonstrate that MDOcean's $<50$ms runtime outperforms leading WEC simulation software by orders of magnitude, while maintaining accuracy within a few percent of the baseline in most cases. 

The obtained optimization results achieve a \pctImproveDesignCostMinLCOE~reduction in modeled cost, \pctImprovePowerMinLCOE~increase in power, and resulting \pctImproveLCOEMinLCOE~decrease in LCOE compared to the original RM3 design. Parameter sensitivity analysis indicates that LCOE depends more strongly on \hl{XX} parameters than \hl{XX} and that the optimal design is sensitive to \hl{XX}. A Pareto trade-off between cost and power reveals different optimal designs depending on which objective is prioritized, suggesting application-specific design heuristics. Three representative optimal designs are investigated: a minimum-LCOE design for cost-sensitive operations like utility power, a minimum-cost design for small offshore systems with fixed power needs, and a balanced design for intermediate applications.

\section{Conclusion}
% Summary:
In summary, this paper develops fast and accurate semi-analytical models for WEC geometry, hydrodynamics, dynamics, structures, and economics and subsequently applies the Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) framework to maximize power and minimize cost of the RM3 point absorber. 

% Model
The geometry module calculates volumes, areas, and the pitch stability margin with simple algebraic relations. The hydrodynamics module implements the matched eigenfunction expansion method for a dual concentric cylinder geometry to obtain the float radiation coefficients, and interpolates existing BEM solutions to obtain the spar radiation coefficients due to the lack of a damping plate in the current MEEM model. This achieves an order of magnitude speedup compared to the popular BEM solver Capytaine. The dynamics module employs describing functions to extend beyond the typical frequency domain formulation to capture nonlinearites and dynamic constraints such as drag and force saturation. This achieves a three order of magnitude computational speedup over the common dynamics solver WEC-Sim. The structures module uses an equivalent-thickness model of stiffened plates and a library of canonical solution to structural boundary value problems to assess the factor of safety of the float bottom plate, spar shell, and damping plate in cyclic fatigue and storm load cases. This represents, to the authors' knowledge, the only public WEC structural simulation regardless of modeling technique. Finally, the economics module calculates the design-dependent cost based on structural material volume and powertrain force and power rating, then performing a straightforward LCOE calculation. Comparison of the dynamics and float hydrodynamics models against WEC-Sim and BEM respectively across multiple cases serves to comprehensively validate the models, with errors generally less than 1\% for test cases with identical assumptions and around 10\% for more realistic cases with diverging assumptions. The geometry, economics, structures, and spar hydrodynamics are compared against the RM3 report, serving as a less comprehensive yet sufficient validation. Good agreement is observed for all but the spar added mass, storm loads, and structural margins, necessitating the use of a tuning factor for these quantities. All modules integrate into a new open-source package called MDOcean, with a total simulation runtime of \simRuntime~seconds.

% Formulation
The optimization problem formulation is developed systematically and cleverly with numerical implications such as linearity, convergence, and feasibility in mind.
12 design variables representing bulk dimensions, structural thicknesses, and powertrain ratings are chosen.
All disciplines are optimized at once, overcoming the lack of system optimality that would exist for sequential optimization of systems with disciplinary coupling.
Constraints are enforced to prevent numerical overflow and structural failure and to ensure geometric physicality, pitch stability, positive buoyancy, sufficient ballast volume, positive power, and compliance with dynamic limits including powertrain ratings and amplitude restrictions. 
The gradient-based SQP algorithm leverages the problem's underlying smoothness to facilitate convergence and is used for single-objective optimization and to generate seeds for multi-objective optimization. After generating \numParetoSeeds~via the epsilon-constraint method, a gradient-free pattern search fills in the pareto front for a total of \numParetoSearchPoints points.

% Results
Single-objective optimization yields a design with \hl{XX} times lower cost and \hl{XX}\% higher power.
Optimal designs have noticeably larger diameters and drafts, lower above-water spar profiles, thinner structural material, and similarly sized powertrains as the nominal RM3.
Multistart requires \numMultistartRequired~runs to ensure a 95\% chance of finding the presumed global optimum.
Param sens shows XX high and XX low
Location sens shows XX
Modeling assumption sens shows XX
Next, the trade-off between cost and power is found using multi-objective optimization.
Pareto front design heuristics shows XX
Idea of just changing controller doesn't work
Optimization runtime is fast

% Discussion
Key benefits that are limitations in other studies are real structures module, dynamic constraints including force saturation and amplitude limits, nonlinear drag model
Limitations include bad structural model, no PTO dynamics, bad load model, regular waves
Important future work is model enhancements (extending to irregular waves, second order loads, PTO dynamics, other WEC types (OSWEC)), formulation enhancements (more DVs like PTO components, geometric ratios; more requirements like XX), and analysis enhancements (global sensitivity, even more interpretation of the robustness of design conclusions to input and model combinations )

% Impact of findings:
The results of this study will prove useful in future WEC design optimization, opening designers' eyes to the complex trade-off associated with \hl{power and cost}. Areas for future work include \hl{XXX}.
