	abstract = {Damping elements are used in ships and offshore structures as response reduction devices for maintaining the hydrodynamic response within acceptable limits. The use of such elements so far has been based on past experience or using empirical based design approach. An investigation of the wave excitation forces acting on these structures with and without damping elements may give an insight into the damping effects of such elements. Also understanding the flow pattern and the magnitude of flow variation around these elements may be useful to improve the design methods. In the present study, measurement of damping forces and response were carried out to establish the relationship between wave frequency amplitude and damping ratio. It was observed that the damping varies with wave period non-linearly and linearly with wave height. Also it was observed that increase in added mass combined with viscous damping is a key factor for the effectiveness of heave plates in reducing motion response of spar platforms. Of the various configurations tested, the spar with double heave plate at the bottom has higher damping compared to other configurations.},

At first sight, this may appear surprising as the limiting boundary-value problems for the potentials involved are identical. However the solutions are indeterminate to within an additive constant and it is the value of this constant that accounts for the difference. In the present work, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to show that the added mass limits for the two cases differ by an amount that depends very simply on the geometry of the bodies.},

Furthermore, it is shown that the transitions between bang and singular subarcs are discontinuous. Based on these findings the results of a numerical direct method are validated. Finally, the optimal control is used to benchmark an existing MPC strategy. It is found that for active control torque constraints the MPC strategy does not result in the discontinuous singular-bang transitions. However, the difference in harvested power is small.},

This brief paper summarizes a simple, yet powerful approach to wave energy dynamics modeling, and subsequent control design based on impedance matching. Our approach leverages the same concepts that are exploited by a simple FM radio to achieve a feedback controller for wave energy devices that approaches optimal power absorption. If fully utilized, this approach can deliver immediate and consequential reductions to the cost of wave energy. Additionally, this approach provides the necessary framework for control co-design of a wave energy converter, in which an understanding of the control logic allows for synchronous design of the device control system and hardware.},

	abstract = {Spectral-domain models are a relatively efficient method of producing an estimate of the expected response and power capture for wave energy converters (WECs) that are subject to nonlinear forces such as Coulomb (constant) or viscous (quadratic) damping. They are generally faster than time-domain models and more accurate than frequency-domain models. However, these models can only be used for spectral excitation and are not appropriate for use with monochromatic waves. The estimates of the expected responses and power captures are made using the assumption that the individual frequency components in the wave spectra are uncorrelated. Because the results of a spectral-domain model are fundamentally statistical they are not able to provide details of extreme values. The only spectral-domain models that have so far been implemented effectively linearize the nonlinear forces and iterate the linearized equations of motion to determine the expected response. This technique has been validated using time-domain models and wave-tank experiments. The linearization of the WEC dynamics effectively assumes that the response is Gaussian; however, spectral-domain modelling techniques used in other fields suggest that it should be possible to model non-Gaussian responses, which is expected to increase the range of nonlinearities for which there are solutions in the spectral domain.},

	abstract = {In recent years, wave energy harvesting systems have received considerable attention as an alternative energy source. Within this class of systems, single-point harvesters are popular at least for preliminary studies and proof-of-concept analyses in particular locations. Unfortunately, the large displacements of a single-point wave energy harvester are described by a set of nonlinear equations. Further, the excitation is often characterized statistically and in terms of a relevant power spectral density (PSD) function. In the context of this complex problem, the development of efficient techniques for the calculation of reliable harvester response statistics is quite desirable, since traditional Monte Carlo techniques involve nontrivial computational cost. The paper proposes a statistical linearization technique for conducting expeditiously random vibration analyses of single-point harvesters. The technique is developed by relying on the determination of a surrogate linear system identified by minimizing the mean square error between the linear system and the nonlinear one. It is shown that the technique can be implemented via an iterative procedure, which allows calculating statistics, PSDs, and probability density functions (PDFs) of the response components. The reliability of the statistical linearization solution is assessed vis-à-vis data from relevant Monte Carlo simulations. This novel approach can be a basis for constructing computationally expeditious assessments of various design alternatives.},

	abstract = {Offshore energy machines have great potential: higher capacity factors, more available space, and lower visual impacts than onshore machines. This thesis investigates how combining a wave energy converter (WEC) with a floating wind turbine (FWT) may produce offshore renewable energy cost savings. Attaching the WEC to the FWT greatly reduces the WEC's steel frame, mooring lines, electric transmission lines, and siting/permitting costs, which may comprise 56\% of a standalone WEC's cost. A 5 MW FWT currently requires up to 1700 tons of platform steel and 5700 tons of ballast concrete for stabilization in the ocean. This required material may be reduced if the WEC stabilizes the FWT. This thesis addresses several challenges to designing a combined FWT-WEC. First, parameter sweeps for optimizing ocean machine performance are limited by high dimensionalities and nonlinearities, including power takeoff control and wave viscous forcing, which normally require computationally expensive time-domain simulations. This thesis develops a statistical linearization approach to rapidly compute machine dynamics statistics while accounting for nonlinearities in the frequency domain. It is verified that the statistical linearization method may capture significant dynamics effects that are neglected by the traditional Taylor series linearization approach, while computing the results approximately 100 times faster than time domain simulations. Using Morison's equation for wave viscosity and quasi-steady blade-element/momentum theory for rotor aerodynamics, we find that viscous effects and nonlinear aerodynamics may increase the FWT motion and tower stress by up to 15\% in some wind-sea states compared the the Taylor series linearized system. Second, the WEC must stabilize rather than destabilize the FWT. This thesis investigates the dynamics statistics of dierent FWT-WEC configurations using a long wavelength, structurally coupled model. It is shown that simultaneous targeted energy transfer from both the FWT and waves to the WEC when the WEC and FWT are linked by a tuned spring is unlikely. That being said, this thesis considers heave-mode oscillating water column WEC's that are linked to the FWT platform by 4-bar linkages, so that the FWT and WEC's are uncoupled for small heave motions and rigidly coupled in all other degrees of freedom. It is shown that this configuration allows the WEC to move with a large amplitude in its energy harvesting degree of freedom, and therefore harvest a significant amount of power without significantly increasing the FWT motion in the same direction. In the rigidly-connected modes, the WEC inertial resistance to motion must be greater than the wave forcing, as these properties are transmitted to the FWT. Third, the WEC requires power robustness in dierent sea states. Typical WEC's require control schemes to maintain good power performance when the ocean wave dominant frequency differs from the WEC resonant frequency. This thesis introduces a nonlinearity into the WEC design that passively increases power adaptability in dierent sea states. While the optimized nonlinear WEC requires 57\% more steel than the optimized linear WEC, the nonlinear WEC produces 72\% more power on average, resulting in a 3\% lower levelized cost of energy. Further optimization of the nonlinear WEC may find improved performance. This thesis determines that attaching a single linear hinged floating spar oscillating water column to the FWT reduces the levelized cost of energy from \$0.31/kWh for the standalone system to \$0.27/kWh (13\%) without changing stress on the FWT tower. Attaching a single nonlinear hinged floating spar oscillating water column to the FWT reduces the levelized cost of energy to \$0.26/kWh (16\%) and reduces the lifetime equivalent fatigue stress on the FWT tower from 32.4 MPa to 31 MPa (5\%). A 6-unit array of the nonlinear WEC's encircling the FWT platform may generate an average of 400 kW while reducing the FWT tower stress by over 50\%. In wave tank experiments, the response statistics of four dierent combined FWT-WEC configurations are measured, verifying the FWT-WEC dynamics model.},

In this paper, we present a relaxation to the modeling assumptions that must be made to apply this theory. Specifically, we propose a technique that uses the principle of Gaussian Closure to accommodate nonlinear WEC dynamics in the synthesis of the optimal feedback law. The technique is approximate, in the sense that it arrives at a computationally efficient control synthesis technique through a Gaussian approximation of the stationary stochastic response of the system. This approach allows for a wide range of nonlinear dynamical models to be considered, and also accommodates many complex loss mechanisms in the power transmission system. The technique is demonstrated through simulation examples pertaining to a flap-type WEC with a hydraulic power train.},

	abstract = {Hybrid offshore renewable energy platforms have been proposed to optimise power production and reduce the levelised cost of energy by integrating or co-locating several renewable technologies. One example is a hybrid wave-wind energy system that combines offshore wind turbines with wave energy converters (WECs) on a single floating foundation. The design of such systems involves multiple parameters and performance measures, making it a complex, multi-modal, and expensive optimisation problem. This paper proposes a novel, robust and effective multi-objective swarm optimisation method (DMOGWA) to provide a design solution that best compromises between maximising WEC power output and minimising the effect on wind turbine nacelle acceleration. The proposed method uses a chaotic adaptive search strategy with a dynamic archive of non-dominated solutions based on diversity to speed up the convergence rate and enhance the Pareto front quality. Furthermore, a modified exploitation technique (Discretisation Strategy) is proposed to handle the large damping and spring coefficient of the Power Take-off (PTO) search space. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method, we compare the DMOGWA with four well-known multi-objective swarm intelligence methods (MOPSO, MALO, MODA, and MOGWA) and four popular evolutionary multi-objective algorithms (NSGA-II, MOEA/D, SPEA-II, and PESA-II) based on four potential deployment sites on the South Coast of Australia. The optimisation results demonstrate the dominance of the DMOGWA compared with the other eight methods in terms of convergence speed and quality of solutions proposed. Furthermore, adjusting the hybrid wave-wind model’s parameters (WEC design and PTO parameters) using the proposed method (DMOGWA) leads to a considerably improved power output (average proximate boost of 138.5\%) and a notable decline in wind turbine nacelle acceleration (41\%) throughout the entire operational spectrum compared with the other methods. This improvement could lead to millions of dollars in additional income per year over the lifespan of hybrid offshore renewable energy platforms.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the first and second-order stochastic responses of oscillating water columns (OWCs) under random waves. The OWCs’ nonlinear dynamics are computed in the frequency domain, where sources of nonlinearities are replaced by equivalent polynomial terms up to second order by minimising their difference in a mean-square sense. This procedure is known as the statistical quadratisation (SQ) technique. In such an approach, the linear and quadratic coefficients are obtained using an iterative procedure and non-Gaussian distributions based on Gram–Charlier expansions, and the dynamics are solved using the Volterra theory. The results are compared against a statistical linearisation model (SL), and nonlinear time-domain simulations (TD) to illustrate the capabilities of the method. The result demonstrated an excellent agreement for the first and second-order motions of the water column obtained using statistical quadratisation compared to nonlinear time-domain simulations in terms of spectral response and probability distribution. Along with the good accuracy, the statistical quadratisation has the advantage of being approximately two orders of magnitude faster than nonlinear time-domain simulations. For the proposed systems, the nonlinearity from the variable mass system (inertial type) is shown to be the most important source of second-order effects driving the oscillating water column dynamics based on the environmental conditions and drafts investigated in this work.},

	abstract = {The viscous drag acting on wave energy converters may have a significant effect on the dynamics during high-energetic sea states and large motions experienced due to resonance. The viscous drag is a nonlinear phenomenon of floating systems usually modelled based on the Morison’s equation using the relative velocity between the structure and the wave particle. To include such a nonlinearity into the system dynamics, nonlinear time domain simulations are generally employed, which are computationally expensive compared to frequency domain simulations. To overcome this problem, this work presents the derivation of the viscous drag force/torque under the statistical linearization technique using the frequency domain model. The technique offers a reliable tool for the estimation of the system dynamics while maintaining a low computational cost when compared to time domain simulations. For the proposed nonlinearity, the resulting equivalent linear term can be decomposed into two components: an excitation term and a damping term. To illustrate the applicability of the derivation, two conceptually different wave energy converters are investigated: a heaving point absorber, and an oscillating wave surge converter. The results obtained using statistical linearization are compared to their respective nonlinear time domain simulations to verify the reliability of the technique. Also, a comparison between the statistical linearization results using the relative motion and using only the structure motion is presented to illustrate the importance of including the relative velocity for wave energy applications. Excellent agreements have been obtained between statistical linearization model using the relative motion and its respective nonlinear time domain model for both devices in terms of spectral content, probability density of the velocity components, and energy absorbed by the device.},

To do so, we employ Rainey’s equation, which can be seen as an extension of the inertial part of Morison’s equation to include nonlinear effects. We introduce modifications to Rainey’s formulation in order to evaluate wave kinematics at the mean body position instead of the original approach of considering instantaneous displacements. We also propose a simple approximation to partially account for wave scattering effects on the second-order loads based on the analytical solution of a surface-piercing bottom-mounted vertical circular cylinder. Though limited to structures composed of cylinders, this slender-body approach is orders of magnitude faster than computing second-order wave coefficients with a radiation/diffraction code. We implemented this approach for difference-frequency (slow drift) loads in an open-source frequency-domain floating wind turbine model. We present comparisons against results obtained with radiation/diffraction theory for three reference floating wind turbine designs: the OC3-Hywind spar, the OC4-DeepCwind semisubmersible, and the VolturnUS-S semisubmersible. In general, the results show that the proposed slender-body approach with the correction to approximate wave scattering effects provides useful estimations of the difference-frequency wave loads and the resulting motions of the floater.},

	abstract = {The second-order diffraction problem by a piston-like arrangement that consists of two concentric surface piercing cylinders is considered. The developed matched axisymmetric eigenfunction expansion solution methodology in cylindrical co-ordinates is based on the semi-analytical formulation of the velocity potentials in the various fluid regions which are defined by the geometry of the two-body arrangement. The main difficulty associated with the specific configuration originates from the fact that the geometry defines two fluid regions that extend up to the free surface in which the inhomogeneous second-order free surface boundary condition has to be fulfilled. To this end the associated velocity potentials in these regions are decomposed into a number of components defining the so-called ‘free’ and ‘locked’ waves. The latter are calculated by solving the resulting Sturm–Liouville problems. The seek second-order velocity potential in the whole fluid domain is then derived by enforcing matching conditions for the radial velocities and the fluid pressures at the cylindrical boundaries of adjacent fluid domains. Numerical results concerning the second-order hydrodynamic loading and the wave run-up on the cylinders are given, whereas special attention is given at incident wave frequency regions where the first-order exciting wave forces attain maximum values due to the resonant fluid motions in the moonpool.},

A perturbation procedure is applied to analyse the wave radiation problem up to the second order in frequency domain. The technique of control surfaces is used to overcome the difficulty associated with the singularity of the fluid velocity at the corner, and a novel solution to the double-frequency wave radiation force on a surging/heaving truncated cylinder is developed. The proposed solution achieves an obvious advantage in that the calculation of the singular terms owing to the singularity of the fluid velocity at a sharp corner is avoided. After examining the convergence and validity of the proposed model, numerical studies are conducted. Numerical results reveal that the force component associated with the body-surface forcing term predominates among the various force components of the total double-frequency wave radiation force. In addition, the force component from the quadratic products of the first-order quantities is in general out-of-phase with the one associated with the body-surface forcing term.},

This is particularly applicable in combination with wind and solar photovoltaics, as the offsetting of these renewable resources results in more reliable renewable generation. This study utilises ten metrics to quantify the temporal complementarity and supply-demand balancing requirements of the energy mix in Great Britain, to investigate the potential magnitude of these system benefits. Wave and tidal generation profiles are created using historical resource data and hydrodynamic models. The results show that the inclusion of wave and tidal generation creates a renewable energy mix which is more available under multiple conditions: throughout a year of operation; at times of peak demand; for multiple consecutive hourly time periods; and at times when wind and solar generation are not available. Three regional case studies also show that the inclusion of marine energy allows for improved regional supply-demand matching, reducing instances of energy shortage and excess and potentially relieving transmission congestion at particularly constrained locations within GB. Finally, the implications of these findings are discussed in terms of GB wholesale market operation, system balancing and system security.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the applicability of marine renewable energy (MRE) for potential grid applications is presented. We show that many of the unique value streams from marine-based electricity generation resources stem from their inherent temporal characteristics, especially when compared to wind and solar. Specifically, in this work, we evaluate the timing value for three types of MRE resources: (a) tidal, (b) wave, and (c) ocean currents. First, through a suite of novel metrics, such as resource availability, persistence, and versatility, we evaluate the temporal value characteristics of these resources. Second, through a more grid-oriented numerical study, we comment on the potential ramifications of those temporal characteristics in context of energy balancing and effective load carrying capability for one marine-based resource i.e., wave. Finally, we further our understanding of the relative advantages that may be leveraged by operating wave-based generation in tandem with more established renewable resources, such as wind and solar. Our results indicate that compared to wind and solar, MRE resources are consistently more available and persistent on an hourly level throughout an entire year of operation. In addition, wave resources are also seen to reduce the balancing requirements within the power system. Our work focuses on sites specific to the United States (US) and a parallel study for a location in Great Britain (GB). Results are found to be consistent for sites in both the US and GB, implying that the grid benefits discussed in this work could apply to a number of locations globally.},

One such example is the Reference Model 3 (RM3), a two-body point absorber wave energy converter (WEC). An assessment using the Technology Performance Level (TPL) revealed that RM3’s low power-to-cost ratio, partly due to expensive steel construction, limits its techno-economic performance. This study aims to redesign RM3 by reducing its scale and employing control co-design to integrate WEC and Power Take-Off (PTO) dynamics, constraints, and cost considerations within an optimization framework. We demonstrate the limitations of RM3’s current PTO design and explore the benefits of scaling down to enhance techno-economic viability by lowering material costs. Using WecOptTool, we conduct a parameter sweep over gear ratios and spring stiffnesses for various Commercial Off-The-Shelf generators in irregular wave conditions. Our findings emphasize the importance of aligning PTO components with WEC dynamics, showing that control co-design and strategic scaling can improve RM3’s power-to-cost ratio. This study presents a transferable example of applied control co-design for other WECs, supporting early-stage developers in their design decisions.},

	abstract = {Accurately predicting wave-structure interactions is critical for the effective design and analysis of marine structures. This is typically achieved using solvers that employ the boundary element method (BEM), which relies on linear potential flow theory. Precise estimation of the sensitivity of these interactions is equally important for system-level applications such as design optimization. Current BEM solvers are unable to provide these sensitivities as they are not differentiable. To address these challenges, we have developed a fully-differentiable BEM solver for marine hydrodynamics, capable of calculating diffraction and radiation coefficients, and their derivatives with high accuracy. This new solver implements both direct and indirect BEM formulations and incorporates two Green's function expressions, offering a trade-off between accuracy and computational speed. Gradients are computed using reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) within the Julia programming language. As a first case study, we analyze two identical floating spheres, evaluating gradients with respect to physical dimensions, inter-sphere distance, and wave frequency. Validation studies demonstrate excellent agreement between AD-computed gradients and finite-difference results. In a second case study, we leverage AD-computed gradients to optimize the mechanical power production of a pair of wave energy converters (WECs). This represents the first application of gradients in WEC power optimization, offering valuable insights into hydrodynamic interactions and advancing the understanding of layout optimization for maximum efficiency. Beyond power optimization, the differentiable BEM solver highlights the potential of AD for offshore design studies.},

	abstract = {Wave energy converters (WECs) represent an innovative technology for power generation from renewable sources (marine energy). Although there has been a great deal of research into such devices in recent decades, the power output of a single device has remained low. Therefore, installation in parks is required for economic reasons. The optimal design problem for parks of WECs is challenging since it requires the simultaneous optimization of positions and control parameters. While the literature on this problem usually considers metaheuristic algorithms, we present a novel numerical framework based on a gradient-flow formulation. This framework is capable of solving the optimal design problem for WEC parks. In particular, we use a low-order adaptive Runge-Kutta scheme to integrate the gradient-flow equation and introduce an inexact solution procedure. Here, the tolerances of the linear solver used for projection on the constraint nullspace and of the time-advancing scheme are automatically adapted to avoid over-solving so that the method requires minimal tuning. We then provide the specific details of its application to the considered WEC problem: the goal is to maximize the average power produced by a park, subject to hydrodynamic and dynamic governing equations and to the constraints of available sea area, minimum distance between devices, and limited oscillation amplitude around the undisturbed free surface elevation. A suitable choice of the discrete models allows us to compute analytically the Jacobian of the state problem's residual. Numerical tests with realistic parameters show that the proposed algorithm is efficient, and results of physical interest are obtained.},

Next, we propose a new algorithm called for the biobjective optimization (BOP) problem (i.e., MOP with two objective functions). The property that Pareto points may be ordered in BOP and not in MOP is exploited by our algorithm. generates an approximation of the Pareto front by solving a series of single-objective formulations of BOP. These single-objective problems are solved using the recent   (mesh adaptive direct search) algorithm for nonsmooth optimization. The Pareto front approximation is shown to satisfy some first order necessary optimality conditions based on the Clarke calculus.

	abstract = {Contains the Reference Model 3 (RM3) spreadsheets with the cost breakdown structure (CBS) for the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) calculations for a single RM3 device and multiple unit arrays. These spreadsheets are contained within an XLSX file and a spreadsheet editor such as Microsoft Excel is needed to open the file. This data was generated upon completion of the project on September 30, 2014. 

The Reference Model Project (RMP), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), was a partnered effort to develop open-source MHK point designs as reference models (RMs) to benchmark MHK technology performance and costs, and an open-source methodology for design and analysis of MHK technologies, including models for estimating their capital costs, operational costs, and levelized costs of energy. The point designs also served as open-source test articles for university researchers and commercial technology developers. The RMP project team, led by Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), included a partnership between DOE, three national laboratories, including the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the Applied Research Laboratory of Penn State University, and Re Vision Consulting.

Reference Model 3 (RM3) is a wave point absorber, also referred to as a wave power buoy, that was designed for a reference site located off the shore of Eureka in Humboldt County, California. The design of the device consists of a surface float that translates (oscillates) with wave motion relative to a vertical column spar buoy, which connects to a subsurface reaction plate. This two-body point absorber converts wave energy into electrical power predominately from the devices heave oscillation induced by incident waves; the float is designed to oscillate up and down the vertical shaft up to 4 m. The bottom of the reaction plate is about 35 m below the water surface. The device is targeted for deployment in water depths of 40 m to 100 m. The point absorber is also connected to a mooring system to keep the floating device in position.},

	abstract = {The sizing of an electrical machine for a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) can have a substantial impact on the overall sizing, cost, and rating of the device. An electrical generator is typically part of the power take-off system, which is the mechanism by which the energy absorbed by the prime mover is transformed into usable electrical energy. For practically all WECs, the rate of change of actuation is predominantly determined by the wave resource (i.e., the wave height and frequency), and devices will see a sinusoidal varying velocity according to the wave conditions. The same can then be said for both directly and indirectly coupled power take-offs with electrical generators. This techno-economic study investigates electrical machine scaling and associated cost implications through core machine design theory, manufacturer data, supporting literature, and the Reference Model Project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy. The Reference Model Project was a partnered effort to develop open-source marine energy point designs as reference models to benchmark marine energy technology performance and costs, methods for design and analysis of marine energy technologies, estimations for capital costs, operational costs, and levelized cost of energy. The results from this study show torque is directly related to (1) the physical size of the machine required to increase the air-gap sheer stresses, (2)the amount of active material, (3) the support structure, (4) bearing size and rating, and (5) offshore cable rating, all of which have a significant effect on overall system costs in terms of both capital and operational expenditures. This paper aims to be a critical benchmark in helping determine an “optimal” nameplate rating for wave energy devices and their associated power take-offs. With an optimized rating and sizing process, WEC costs can be reduced and overall performance can be improved.},

There has been a general lack of technology convergence in the wave energyindustry and PTO design has been largely device-specific with the design process determined by the WEC developer. An optimizedPTO design can significantly affect the efficiency, reliability, performance, and overall cost and viability of a device. There remains a need in the marine energy industry for best practices and efficient design processes to be identified as it could greatly benefit developers and researchers in designing an optimal WEC PTO.The results from the extensive modelling and analysis effort in this research indicate that there may be an optimal sizing for WEC PTOs for both power and PTO force rating and that substantial reductions can be made in the cost of a device without significant loss in the energy produced. Furthermore, this optimal sizing may be independent of WEC type and deployment location.With an optimal, or near optimal, approach to WEC PTO sizing demonstrated, a methodology is proposed to address the challenge of nameplate ratings in the wave energy industry.},

The computed parameters are especially needed for the development of a simple hydrodynamic time-dependant model, based on the Cummins' formulation. This model is intended for WEC control purposes. A semi-analytical approach is proposed for the computation of the hydrodynamic coefficients and the excitation forces. The boundary value problem is solved by using variable separation and matched eigenfunction expansion methods. Analytical expressions for the velocity potential are then obtained for each subdomain. The hydrodynamic coefficients and the excitation force can then be computed by using these expressions. Numerical results are given for different buoy, column, and plate radii and clearly the bearing surface of the plate has a significant influence on the wave excitation force applied to the submerged platform.},

Multiple linearized models derived from aero-elastic simulation software in different operating regions characterized by the incoming wind speed are combined to construct an approximate low-fidelity model of the system. The combined model is then used to generate open-loop, optimal control trajectories as part of a nested control co-design strategy that explores the system’s power production and stability using the platform pitch tilt as a proxy in the context of crucial plant and control design decisions. The radial distance between the central and outer columns and the diameter of the outer columns of the semisubmersible platform are the plant design variables. The platform stability and power production are studied for different plant design decisions. The effect of plant decisions on subsequent power production and stability response of the floating wind turbine is quantified in terms of the levelized cost of energy. The results show that the inner-loop constraints and the plant design decisions affect the turbine’s power and, subsequently, the cost of the system.},

	abstract = {Floating body hydrodynamics are typically solved numerically using the boundary element method. Theassociated code is computationally costly, scaling with the number of mesh panels, and can have accuracy issues atspecific frequencies and for thin bodies. In this work, we instead implement a previously-developed matchedeigenfunction expansion method to semi-analytically solve the linear potential flow radiation problem foraxisymmetric bodies. This method first establishes distinct fluid regions based on the body geometry and expressesthe velocity potential as a function of vertical and radial basis functions (eigenfunctions) with unknown coefficients.Eigenfunctions are chosen to automatically enforce several boundary conditions of the problem. The coefficients arefound by truncating and solving an infinite linear system representing the matching of potential and radial velocityacross fluid region boundaries. This yields a solution for the 3D potential and the hydrodynamic coefficients. Wecompare the results and computational complexity of the matched eigenfunction expansion method with that of thestandard boundary element method. Benefits of the former include 10x faster solve time and lack of meshing, whichare particularly appealing in optimization workflows. Our framework will be released as an open-source pythonpackage to enable future integration with design tools, implementation of gradients, and democratization of thisefficient method. This is a meaningful contribution because prior relevant implementations of the matchedeigenfunction expansion method are, to the authors’ knowledge, private and not available open-source or evencommercially. Future work will extend this formulation to different kinds of bodies and arrays.},

This work presents the first known boundary element method solver with implicit analytic derivatives, allowing for total derivative computation alongside force evaluation. Two case studies are presented: a single floating circular column and a structure with multiple square columns attached to a horizontal pontoon. Force results from both case studies agree well with reference data, while derivative results agree with the best comparisons available.

The use of such elements so far has been based on past experience or using empirical based design approach. An investigation of the wave excitation forces acting on these structures with and without damping elements may give an insight into the damping effects of such elements. Also understanding the flow pattern and the magnitude of flow variation around these elements may be useful to improve the design methods. In the present study, measurement of damping forces and response were carried out to establish the relationship between wave frequency amplitude and damping ratio. It was observed that the damping varies with wave period non-linearly and linearly with wave height. Also it was observed that increase in added mass combined with viscous damping is a key factor for the effectiveness of heave plates in reducing motion response of spar platforms. Of the various configurations tested, the spar with double heave plate at the bottom has higher damping compared to other configurations.},

	abstract = {Wave energy is a significant source of renewable energy harnessed by wave energy converters (WECs). However, due to the relatively high levelised cost of energy (LCoE), wave energy has not attained a commercial stage yet. To minimise the LCoE, since the optimum (uncontrolled) WEC design typically differs from the optimum controlled WEC design, control co-design (CCD) techniques are essential. With CCD, the WEC control-related aspects are taken into account from the start of the WEC design phase and, ideally, the best control-informed WEC design is then achieved. This paper specifically focuses on CCD for an oscillating-water-column (OWC) WEC, equipped with a Wells turbine and a bypass valve. In essence, a parametric CCD approach is devised to find the optimum (control-informed) turbine rotor diameter, and bypass valve diameter, for the considered OWC WEC. In particular, the optimum design parameters minimise a ‘simplified’ LCoE, which is chosen as a suitable performance function. Despite the LCoE is primarily sensitive to the power take-off size, rather than to the bypass valve size, peak-shaving control with a bypass valve potentially increases the capacity factor and, consequently, can minimise the LCoE for small-to-medium sized turbines.},

In this study, a fast optimal control performance evaluation method is proposed based on a ‘wave-by-wave’ (WbW) representation. The idea is to split the wave excitation force (WEF) signals into individual waves, process them separately, and then combine the results with the distribution of WEF amplitude and period, yielding a straightforward average power calculation. The method is fully developed and studied, considering the cases of position-only, and general, constraints, as well as different choices to obtain the WEF parameter distribution. It is shown that the WbW method can achieve a very high control evaluation fidelity (within a 5\% error) and give almost the same co-design result as MPC and PS (implemented using WecOptTool), but with a significantly reduced computation time (e.g., hundreds of times faster), therefore being a game changer for control co-design of WECs.},

	abstract = {Researchers are exploring adding wave energy converters to existing oceanographic buoys to provide a predictable source of renewable power. A ”pitch resonator” power take-off system has been developed that generates power using a geared flywheel system designed to match resonance with the pitching motion of the buoy. However, the novelty of the concept leaves researchers uncertain about various design aspects of the system. This work presents a novel design study of a pitch resonator to inform design decisions for an upcoming deployment of the system. The assessment uses control co-design via WecOptTool to optimize control trajectories for maximal electrical power production while varying five design parameters of the pitch resonator. Given the large search space of the problem, the control trajectories are optimized within a Monte Carlo analysis to identify optimal designs, followed by parameter sweeps around the optimum to identify trends between the design parameters. The gear ratio between the pitch resonator spring and flywheel are found to be the most sensitive design variables to power performance. The assessment also finds similar power generation for various sizes of resonator components, suggesting that correctly designing for optimal control trajectories at resonance is more critical to the design than component sizing.},

	abstract = {The WaveTrain device is a wave energy converter concept designed to extend the high performance of buoys that undergo sloped motion into a deep water environment. It achieves this by mechanically interconnecting a series of sloped modules, amongst which restorative forces can be exchanged in order to prevent detrimental pitching motion, whilst sufficiently free motion along the inclined axis is retained. Importantly, this circumvents the requirement of a rigid seabed connection, but introduces a potential vulnerability of operational failure of the rotational joints that link each connecting strut to the adjacent module. In this paper, the impact of considering the fatigue damage accumulating at the joints, in addition to the power extraction, is investigated with regards to the optimal design of the WaveTrain device. A specially-tailored multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to explore the optimal design candidates with two variants of the pair of conflicting objectives (power extraction and fatigue damage). Some key design criteria are then presented, with reference and comparison to the design criteria that are considered optimal when only power extraction is considered.},

Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 116, pp. 578-582. Charlotte (North Carolina), ISSN 0749-0208.The wave overtopping system in wave power generation systems is called the Overtopping Wave Energy Converter (OWEC). The performance of the OWEC is affected by wave height and period. Wave characteristics, such as wave height, period, and direction, vary with environmental conditions, which make it difficult for the OWEC to generate stable electric power. To mitigate this issue, appropriate OWEC designs based on environmental conditions and wave characteristics must be investigated. In this study, the hydraulic efficiency of the OWEC and the load acting on it were calculated using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) based on the environmental conditions along the Ulleungdo coast, and the structural safety of the optimized OWEC model was verified. Moreover, a particle-based simulation was performed to confirm the effect of design parameters on energy efficiency. Additionally, the load acting on the OWEC was calculated, and the optimization method was used to design six types of substructures. Finally, structural analysis was conducted, confirming that all six types avoided the design model's structural resonance period.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have focused on optimising wave energy converter (WEC) designs, maximising their power performance and techno-economic feasibility. Reliability has yet to be fully considered in these formulations, despite its impact on cost and performance. In this study, this gap is addressed by developing a reliability-based design optimisation framework for WEC hull geometries to explore the trade-off between power performance and power take-off (PTO) system damage equivalent loading (DEL). Optimised hull geometries for two sites are considered (from the centre of the North Sea and off the west coast of Norway), and two directions of motions (heave and surge). Results indicate that site characteristics affect the potential power production and DEL for an optimal WEC design. These are also affected by the direction of motion for power extraction, which also significantly changes optimal hull shape characteristics. Optimal surging WEC designs have edges facing oncoming wave directions, while heaving WECs have pointed bottoms, both to streamline movement. Larger, more convex WECs result in greater power production and DEL, while smaller, more concave WECs result in lesser power production and DEL. These findings underline the importance of considering WEC hull geometry in early design processes to optimise cost, power production, and reliability.},

Different active and passive control strategies are implemented (proportional (P) controller, proportional-integral (PI) controller, proportional-integral-derivative with memory compensation (PID) controller, model predictive control (MPC) and maximum energy controller (MEC)), and load time-series resulting from numerical simulations are used to design structural parts based on fatigue analysis using rain-flow counting, Stress-Number (SN) curves and Miner’s rule. The objective of the methodology is to obtain a cost-effective WEC with a more comprehensive analysis of a WEC based on a combination of well known control strategies and standardised fatigue methods. The presented method is then applied to a particular case study, the Wavestar WEC, for a specific location in the North Sea. Results, which are based on numerical simulations, show the importance of balancing the gained power against structural fatigue. Based on a simple cost model, the PI controller is shown as a viable solution.},

These studies have been performed for different types of devices, applying a number of optimisation algorithms and representing power generation and costs with various strategies. The definition of the optimisation problem and the use of the most suitable strategies is key for a successful optimisation process, which will provide meaningful results and support device design at early development stages.

A conventional resource assessment approach only evaluates the wave power based on wave characteristics, which is insufficient to capture the practical power absorption variations between WEC archetypes. In this paper, a novel WEC net power assessment (WNPA) method is proposed and is generally applicable to any arbitrary WECs design. Two theoretical upper bounds of wave power absorption are adopted and derived for different types of WECs. Numerical simulations are conducted to apply this novel technique to assess the net power available to different WECs at the Wave Energy Test Site (WETS), Hawaii and the PacWave site, Oregon over 11 years. By comparing the power potential for WECs oscillating in different degrees of freedom, the results indicate the surging mode may be the most energetic; regardless of shapes and ocean sites. When applied to three generic WECs (point absorber, terminator, and attenuator), the pitching terminator is shown to have lower absorption potential. Finally, the mean annual energy production (MAEP) of the three generic WECs at WETS and PacWave are compared, and a surging attenuator shows a significant wave power potential at PacWave.},

However, cost reductions are still required for this technology to be commercially competitive. To achieve commercialisation at a reasonable expense, disruptive innovations at early stages of development need to be enabled. Thus, to explore more of the design space, design limits need to be defined. Although physical limits, such as the maximum capture width and the Budal upper bound, have been defined, more realistic limits considering the variability of the resource, device dimensions and the actual hydrodynamic behaviour of different shapes can help provide further insights. This is relevant to both technology developers and funding bodies wanting to identify potential areas for innovation. In this study, the use of multi-objective optimisation is proposed to explore these limits, by investigating the optimal relationship between average annual power production and device size. This relationship depends on resource level, mode of motion used for power extraction and hull shape. The obtained fundamental relationships fall within the existing physical limits, but provide further insights into the impact of different factors on these limits. This allows for a more direct comparison with the performance of state-of-the-art wave energy converters.},

This work considers the floating sphere used in the OES Task 10 WEC modeling and verification effort for analysis. Analytical equations are derived to determine bounds on displacement amplitude, time-averaged power (TAP), and power-take-off (PTO) force. A unique result found shows that the TAP absorbed by a WEC can be defined solely by the inertial properties and radiation hydrodynamic coefficients. In addition, a unique expression for the PTO force was derived that provides lower and upper bounds when resistive control is used to maximize power generation. For complex conjugate control, this same expression only provides a lower bound, as there is theoretically no upper bound. These bounds assist in comparing the performance of the floating sphere if it were to extract energy using surge or heave motion. The analysis shows because of differences in hydrodynamic coefficients for each oscillating mode, there are different frequency ranges that provide better power capture efficiency. The influence of a motion constraint on TAP while utilizing a nonideal power take-off is examined and found to reduce the losses associated with bidirectional energy flow. The expression to calculate TAP with a nonideal PTO is modified by the electrical conversion efficiency and the ratio of the PTO spring and damping coefficients. The PTO spring and damping coefficients were separated in the expression, allowing for limits to be set on the PTO coefficients to ensure net power generation.},

One main contribution of this paper is the integration of nonlinear hydrodynamics and nonlinear control during the optimization of the WEC’s buoy shape. This approach is referred to as Control Co-Design (CCD). In this work, we present a control co-designed nonlinear heaving point absorber WEC that leverages the nonlinear dynamic, static Froude–Krylov (FK) forces to maximize power extraction. The nonlinear FK forces are approximated using a variation of the algebraic solution; the hydrodynamic forces of the body are computed using an analytic formulation leveraging the methods of eigenfunction expansion and separation of variables. The nonlinear geometry of the buoy is modeled as a series of inclined panels; the inclination angles are optimized to arrive at the optimal shape. The performance of the optimized shape is compared to that of a nonlinear spherical WEC. It is found that an average of 20\% improvement is achieved by the optimized geometry over the spherical device.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel Triple Coaxial-cylinder Wave-Energy Converter (TCWEC) system, as an evolution of the commonly deployed dual-coaxial cylinder WEC (DCWEC). TCWEC consists of one inner cylinder and two concentric outer cylinders, characterized by two coupled resonant frequencies, improving wave power absorption. A semi-analytical model, based on potential flow theory and matched eigenfunction expansions, is developed to analyze the 3-Degrees of Freedom (DOF) system. The viscous drag coefficients are determined by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and employed as equivalent linear damping. Analysis of impact of the viscous flow-separation factor fvis on the capture width indicates that the higher energy-absorption capability of TCWEC is not merely attributed to a smaller fvis value, but rather a planned split of the outer cylinder in DCWEC design into two cylinders in TCWEC, so as to produce an effectively broader resonance property. Under identical sea conditions, it is found that, compared to DCWEC, the optimal capture width of TCWEC is increased by as much as 77\% in regular waves. In irregular waves, the optimal capture width is increased up to 40\% across the entire frequency range. These findings suggest that the energy absorption efficiency of TCWEC is promising and its potential for real-world applications.},

	abstract = {Wave energy converters (WEC) are complex systems comprising multiple subsystems including wave capture structure and station keeping, power takeoff (PTO), and control. Designing the whole WEC system requires an effective design approach that considers mutual couplings among them throughout the entire design process. Moreover, the traditional serial design approach, transitioning from small-scale to full-scale designs incrementally, often overlooks issues related to scaling factors. This can lead to unexpected challenges and delays towards real ocean deployment. To address system-level considerations and scaling challenges in WEC design, this study introduces a novel multi-scale concurrent design approach. It facilitates full-scale WEC design from the early concept to ocean test planning. This approach ensures a holistic and effective design process that considers interactions among subsystems at each design stage and incorporates control co-design starting with early concept development. To demonstrate the presented approach, we introduce a case study focused on the design of a 100 kW floating oscillating surge wave energy converter (FOSWEC) for PacWave South ocean test site. This includes the design of wave capture structure and station keeping, PTO, control, ocean test planning, and techno-economic analysis. The case study showcases the effectiveness of the proposed approach, offering invaluable guidance and insights for future WEC development and support efficient, cost-effective collaboration in WEC design and testing.},

	abstract = {This study utilizes multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) to design an array of heaving wave energy converters (WECs) for grid-scale energy production with decision variables and parameters chosen from the coupled disciplines of geometry, hydrodynamics, layout, motor-actuated reactive controls (with a force maximum constraint) and economics. We vary a WEC's dimensions, array layout, and control gain to minimize two objectives: the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the maximum separation distance. This multi-objective optimization approach results in a set of optimal design configurations that stakeholders can choose from for their specific application and needs. The framework yields a range of optimal (minimum) LCOE values from 0.21 to 0.23 {\textbackslash}\$/kWh and a separation distance ranging from 97 to 62 meters. The WEC radius of 4m is found to be optimal, and the q-factor for optimal designs are greater than 1 up to 1.06 for a rhombus-like layout. Additionally, a post-optimality global sensitivity analysis of a design shows that wave heading, wave frequency, WEC lifetime, amplitude and interest rate accounts for most of the variance. Different designs in the Pareto set may be appealing for different decision makers based on their trade-off analysis. To that end, regression model is developed for design heuristics.},

In particular, an analysis of such international standards panorama exhibits a lack of information and detail regarding WEC system design, and the specific simulations procedures that shall be followed accordingly. In the light of this, this study proposes a standardised design process that can be followed to define the design loads which characterise a structural analysis, which are obtained by high-fidelity models. The device assessment in extreme states is analysed on intact and damaged conditions, where the use of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software is proposed to encompass any non-linear behaviour related to extreme events. Furthermore, this article also describes a fatigue assessment based on linear system theory, with the inclusion of linearised significant terms, such as, e.g. mooring influence on device dynamics.},

However, such nonlinear dynamics typically demand numerical simulation, which increases computational cost and diminishes intuition. This paper instead uses describing functions to approximate a force saturation nonlinearity as a linear impedance mismatch. In the frequency domain, the impact of controller impedance mismatch (such as force limit, finite bandwidth, or parameter error) on electrical power production is shown analytically and graphically for a generic nondimensionalized single degree of freedom wave energy converter in regular waves. Results are visualized with Smith charts. Notably, systems with a specific ratio of reactive to real mechanical impedance are least sensitive to force limits, a criteria which conflicts with resonance and bandwidth considerations. The describing function method shows promise to enable future studies such as large-scale design optimization and co-design.},

The formulation is compatible with a wide variety of support structure configurations and no manual or time-domain preprocessing steps are required, making RAFT very practical in design and optimization workflows. The model is applied to three reference floating wind turbine designs and its predictions are compared with results from time-domain OpenFAST simulations. There is good agreement in mean offsets as well the statistics and spectra of the dynamic response, verifying RAFT’s general suitability for floating wind analysis.

The design problem class is characterized by architectures comprised of linear physical elements and nested co-design optimization problems employing linear-quadratic dynamic optimization. The select problem class leverages a number of existing theory and tools and is particularly effective due to the symbiosis between labeled graph representations of architectures, dynamic models constructed from linear physical elements, linear-quadratic dynamic optimization, and the nested co-design solution strategy. A vehicle suspension case study is investigated and a specifically constructed architecture, plant, and control design problem is described. The result was the automated generation and co-design problem evaluation of 4374 unique suspension architectures. The results demonstrate that changes to the vehicle suspension architecture can result in improved performance, but at the cost of increased mechanical complexity. Furthermore, the case study highlights a number of challenges associated with finding solutions to the considered class of design problems. One such challenge is the requirement to use simplified design problem elements/models; thus, the goal of these early-stage studies are to identify new architectures that are worth investigating more deeply. The results of higher-fidelity studies on a subset of high-performance architectures can then be used to select a final system architecture. In many aspects, the described problem class is the simplest case applicable to graph-representable, dynamic engineering systems.},

	abstract = {System modeling frameworks for wind turbines and plants are used by research groups and industry to design wind energy systems that take into account key trade-offs across performance, cost, and reliability at both the turbine and plant level. The frameworks are exercised using a variety of multi-disciplinary design, analysis and optimization (MDAO) methods. To improve inter-operability and foster collaboration, this report proposes a classification system for the frameworks along dimensions of model fidelity and scope. The classification system is first motivated with reviews the state-of-the-art in the development of software frameworks for integrated wind turbine and plant simulation. Within each major wind turbine and power plant subsystem, a matrix is developed for the disciplines used and the fidelity levels with which each discipline can be modeled. The existing frameworks are then classified according to the matrix. Next, an ontology is proposed that will allow for standardizing how data is transferred between the most common discipline-fidelity combinations used in the frameworks. A common representation of data creates the ability to 1) share system descriptions and analysis results, supporting more transparent benchmarks and comparison, and 2) integrate models together into workflows within and across organizations for improving the efficiency and performance of wind turbine and power plant design processes. Ultimately, this integration leads to better overall wind energy system designs with high performance and low costs.},

	abstract = {This report presents the findings of a case study that evaluates the impact of integrating significant tidal energy generation in the Cook Inlet in Alaska. The case study is part of a series within the "Quantifying the Grid Value of MRE [Marine Renewable Energy] in Early U.S. Markets" project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. This study takes a scenario-based approach to evaluate the tidal energy potential in the Cook Inlet, in which 100-500 megawatts (MW) of tidal energy are integrated into the grid under different infrastructure scenarios. These scenarios include increased energy storage and transmission line upgrades, a "Basecase" scenario with no additional upgrades, and a reference case with no tidal energy. We concluded that tidal energy at an installed capacity of 200-300 MW has the potential to reduce fuel costs in Alaska while also reducing carbon emissions and increasing the energy independence of the state. This analysis and the key findings should be viewed as a starting point for additional research and used to inform investment and policy options.},

This generally ignores or significantly simplifies the performance of real power take-off (PTO) systems. However, including all the required dynamics and constraints in the control problem may considerably vary the control strategy and the power output. Therefore, this paper considers the incorporation into the model of all the conversion stages from ocean waves to the electricity network, referred to as wave-to-wire (W2W) models, and identifies the necessary components and their dynamics and constraints, including grid constraints. In addition, the paper identifies different control inputs for the different components of the PTO system and how these inputs are articulated to the dynamics of the system. Examples of pneumatic, hydraulic, mechanical or magnetic transmission systems driving a rotary electrical generator, and linear electric generators are provided.},

Application of Green’s integral theorem in the fluid domain yields a hypersingular integral equation for the jump in potential across the flap. The solution is found via a series expansion in terms of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and even order. Several relationships are then derived between the hydrodynamic parameters of the system. Comparison is made between the behaviour of the converter in the open ocean and in a channel. The degree of accuracy of wave tank experiments aiming at reproducing the performance of the device in the open ocean is quantified. A parametric analysis of the system is then undertaken. In particular, it is shown that increasing the flap width has the beneficial effect of broadening the bandwidth of the capture factor curve. This phenomenon can be exploited in random seas to achieve high levels of efficiency.},

An interaction theory is developed which solves the complete problem, predicting wave exciting forces, hydrodynamic coefficients and second-order drift forces, but is based algebraically on the diffraction characteristics of single members only. This method, which includes also the diffraction interaction of evanescent waves, is in principle exact (within the context of linearized theory) for otherwise arbitrary configurations and spacings. This is confirmed by a number of numerical examples and comparisons involving two or four axisymmetric legs, where full three-dimensional diffraction calculations for the entire structures are also performed using a hybrid element method. To demonstrate the efficacy of the interaction theory, we apply it finally to an array of 33 (3 by 11) composite cylindrical legs, where experimental data are available. The comparison with measurements shows reasonable agreement.The present method is valid for a large class of arrays of arbitrary individual geometries, number and configuration of bodies with non-intersecting vertical projections. Its application should make it unnecessary to perform full diffraction computations for many multiple-member structures and arrays.},

	abstract = {The floating wind turbine support structure design problem is complicated by conflicting technical objectives and innumerable platform geometry options. Previous support structure optimization studies have been limited in their ability to evaluate the full design space due to their adherence to certain assumptions about the physical platform configuration. The present work is an effort toward developing an alternative form of the support platform optimization problem – one that abstracts details of the platform geometry and deals instead with hydrodynamic performance coefficients – in order to provide a more complete and intuitive exploration of the design space. A basis function approach, which represents the design space by linearly combining the hydrodynamic performance coefficients of a diverse set of basis platform geometries, was taken as the most straightforward way of physically constraining the platform hydrodynamic performance. Candidate designs are evaluated in the frequency domain using linearized coefficients for the wind turbine, platform, and mooring system dynamics. The platform hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated according to linear hydrodynamic theory. The optimization objective is to minimize the nacelle acceleration under several operating conditions. Optimization results for a slack catenary mooring system indicate the benefits of combining submerged volume with a widely dispersed water plane area. Results for a tension leg mooring system are consistent with conventional TLP designs. The intent is to use these results as starting points for more traditional platform parameter optimization. Examination of the possible physical interpretations of linearly combining basis platform coefficients reveals that certain aspects of this approach may have poor physicality. This points to the need to expand this first attempt with more sophisticated ways of representing the constrained hydrodynamic performance variables.},

	abstract = {This study presents theoretical formulations to evaluate the fundamental parameters and performance characteristics of a bottom-raised oscillating surge wave energy converter (OSWEC) device. Employing a flat plate assumption and potential flow formulation in elliptical coordinates, closed-form equations for the added mass, radiation damping, and excitation forces/torques in the relevant pitch-pitch and surge-pitch directions of motion are developed and used to calculate the system's response amplitude operator and the forces and moments acting on the foundation. The model is benchmarked against numerical simulations using WAMIT and WEC-Sim, showcasing excellent agreement. The sensitivity of plate thickness on the analytical hydrodynamic solutions is investigated over several thickness-to-width ratios ranging from 1:80 to 1:10. The results show that as the thickness of the benchmark OSWEC increases, the deviation of the analytical hydrodynamic coefficients from the numerical solutions grows from 3 \% to 25 \%. Differences in the excitation forces and torques, however, are contained within 12 \%. While the flat plate assumption is a limitation of the proposed analytical model, the error is within a reasonable margin for use in the design space exploration phase before a higher-fidelity (and thus more computationally expensive) model is employed. A parametric study demonstrates the ability of the analytical model to quickly sweep over a domain of OSWEC dimensions, illustrating the analytical model's utility in the early phases of design.},

	abstract = {Negative emission technologies (NETs) are considered essential to keep global warming below 2 °C. Situating wind-powered carbon dioxide removal (CDR) devices offshore and injecting carbon dioxide (CO2) into deep-water sub-seafloor basalt aquifers has the potential to offer large CO2 removal capacity. It also avoids land and water-use competition and provides additional low-risk protections against post-injection leakage compared to terrestrial CO2 storage. This paper seeks to identify locations where offshore wind and potential basalt storage locations exist within close proximity to one another around the globe. A global mean wind power density map at 150 m height was computed using 30 years (1986–2016) of ERA5 hourly wind speed reanalysis data. Offshore regions with mean wind speed greater than 8 m/s were identified. Offshore regions with basalt aquifers along seismic or aseismic ridges which provide potential CO2 storage sites were identified and selected based on sediment thickness, age, and distance from plate boundaries. Four scenarios were constructed to capture a range of constraints with implications for technical, economic and regulatory difficulties. For each scenario, eligible regions for CO2 injection were filled by regularly spaced grid points and the distance to the nearest eligible wind resource was calculated for each point to identify the most promising configurations. Total available storage capacity within reach of wind resources was estimated to be between 4,300Gt and 196,000Gt depending on both uncertainties in porosity and other imposed constraints; even the most conservative estimates represent enormous capacity compared to global targets for negative emissions technologies. Typically, the best areas were found close to the poles due to the greater prevalence of good wind resources in those areas. Site-specific properties such as water depth and distance from shore are computed for the identified locations in order to characterize the conditions in which such locations are typically found.},

	abstract = {Injecting CO2 into subsea basalt can provide permanent storage via multiple trapping mechanisms, including mineralization reactions which convert the CO2 into solid carbonates over time. Injecting CO2 together with water can accelerate the process of mineralization, but presents additional challenges, such as high energy and water requirements. A techno-economic model of CO2 transport and injection into ocean basalt was developed to compare injection strategies using pure supercritical CO2, pure liquid CO2, and CO2 dissolved in seawater. The model was applied to a representative injection site off the coast of British Columbia, Canada. Injection of CO2 dissolved into seawater was found to be more energy and cost intensive than injection of supercritical or liquid CO2; this is primarily due to the reduced quantities of CO2 that can be injected into each well, and additional pumping energy required for the accompanying seawater. For the base assumptions, transport and storage costs for supercritical, liquid, and dissolved injection were estimated as \$43/t, \$38/t, and \$250/t respectively. Their energy requirements were estimated as 93 kWh/t, 90 kWh/t, and 213 kWh/t respectively. The current best estimates of geological parameters for ocean basalt suggest good injectivity and very large storage capacities per well. This may help to compensate for the additional project expenses incurred by deep water, allowing cost-effective liquid and supercritical injection. However, this result is sensitive to high uncertainties in both geological parameters and component cost data.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigated how the added mass, the hydrodynamic damping and the drag coefficient of a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) can be calculated using DualSPHysics. DualSPHysics is a software application that applies the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method, a Lagrangian meshless method used in a growing range of applications within the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Furthermore, the effect of the drag force on the WEC’s motion and average absorbed power is analyzed. Particularly under controlled conditions and in the resonance region, the drag force becomes significant and can greatly reduce the average absorbed power of a heaving point absorber. Once the drag coefficient has been determined, it is used in a modified equation of motion in the frequency domain, taking into account the effect of the drag force. Three different methods were compared for the calculation of the average absorbed power: linear potential flow theory, linear potential flow theory modified to take the drag force into account and DualSPHysics. This comparison showed the considerable effect of the drag force in the resonance region. Calculations of the drag coefficient were carried out for three point absorber WECs: one spherical WEC and two cylindrical WECs. Simulations in regular waves were performed for one cylindrical WEC with two different power take-off (PTO) systems: a linear damping and a Coulomb damping PTO system. The Coulomb damping PTO system was added in the numerical coupling between DualSPHysics and Project Chrono. Furthermore, we considered the optimal PTO system damping coefficient taking the effect of the drag force into account.},

	abstract = {This article presents a simple geometrical approach to visualize the hydrodynamic properties of wave energy converters (WECs), in terms of wave reflection, transmission, and absorption, and how those properties are governed by the WEC control parameters. The problem is modeled as an array of periodic rows of WECs parallel to the wave front, which is representative of WEC farms located along the shoreline, and allows for a straightforward two-dimensional analysis of energy fluxes. The WECs are assumed to be symmetric with respect to the plane perpendicular to the wave propagation direction, and they operate in a single degree of freedom. Under those assumptions, fundamental hydrodynamic relationships allow the WEC operation at a given frequency to be mapped to a single complex number, {\textasciicircum}T, which represents the WEC (complex) transmission coefficient, located in a circle with center 1/2 and radius 1/2. The WEC hydrodynamic and control parameters (added mass, stiffness, damping) govern the precise location of {\textasciicircum}T within the circle. The distance of {\textasciicircum}T to the center of the circle determines the hydrodynamic efficiency, between 0 (when {\textasciicircum}T is on the circle border) and 1/2 (which is achieved when {\textasciicircum}T is at the center of the circle). Therefore, the representation of {\textasciicircum}T provides an immediate insight into the balance between reflection, transmission, and absorption. The proposed unified representation reflects, in a didactic way, some fundamental wave energy concepts, common to all WECs, such as the Haskind relationship, or the impedance matching condition for optimal wave power absorption. Two numerical examples illustrate how the locus of {\textasciicircum}T, across a prescribed frequency range, provides a distinctive “signature” specific to the WEC geometry, mode of operation, and control strategy. Finally, the proposed representation shows many similarities to the Smith chart and, as such, is but one additional analogy between wave energy conversion and electrical engineering.},

Under this hypothesis, linear techniques for the control of the extracted power, as passive loading and optimum control, are well known and widely analyzed. It can be shown, however, how their performances are fundamentally different when irregular waves are considered and the theoretical superiority of optimum control is questionable under real wave conditions. Moreover, the global optimization of WECs implies a rational design of the power electronics equipment. This requires the analysis of the instantaneous extracted power in addition to the average one. In this paper, the impact of irregular waves on the power extraction when using different control techniques is analyzed in the case of a point absorber in heave. It is also shown how a convenient tradeoff between high average power extraction and limited power electronics overrating can be obtained by applying simple power saturation techniques. Moreover, the impact of power conversion efficiency on the control strategy is analyzed.},

	abstract = {Improved power take-off (PTO) controller design for wave energy converters is considered a critical component for reducing the cost of energy production. However, the device and control design process often remains sequential, with the space of possible final designs largely reduced before the controller has been considered. Control co-design, whereby the device and control design are considered concurrently, has resulted in improved designs in many industries, but remains rare in the wave energy community. In this paper we demonstrate the use of a new open-source code, WecOptTool, for control co-design of wave energy converters, with the aim to make the co-design approach more accessible and accelerate its adoption. Additionally, we highlight the importance of designing a wave energy converter to maximize electrical power, rather than mechanical power, and demonstrate the co-design process while modeling the PTO's components (i.e., drive-train and generator, and their dynamics). We also consider the design and optimization of causal fixed-structure controllers. The demonstration presented here considers the PTO design problem and finds the optimal PTO drive-train that maximizes annual electrical power production. The results show a 22\% improvement in the optimal controller and drive-train co-design over the optimal controller for the nominal, as built, device design.},

The equation is useful for cases where it is desirable to know how to position a load (1) to obtain maximum return loss for network-matching purposes or (2) to obtain minimum return loss for some types of reflector antenna applications. Two examples are given: One shows that for some types of reflector antennas with a mesh-type surface that is backed by another reflecting surface, a resonance phenomenon can occur and cause unexpectedly large dissipative losses ({\textgreater}30 dB) to occur. The other example shows that when a particular type of reflector antenna with a dielectric layer becomes wet from rain or condensation, large ({\textgreater}10 dB) signal losses can occur. For both examples, equations presented in this article were used to calculate the exact load-reflection coefficient phase values that led to worst-case return loss values.

A conventional resource assessment approach only evaluates the wave power based on wave characteristics, which is insufficient to capture the practical power absorption variations between WEC archetypes. In this paper, a novel WEC net power assessment (WNPA) method is proposed and is generally applicable to any arbitrary WECs design. Two theoretical upper bounds of wave power absorption are adopted and derived for different types of WECs. Numerical simulations are conducted to apply this novel technique to assess the net power available to different WECs at the Wave Energy Test Site (WETS), Hawaii and the PacWave site, Oregon over 11 years. By comparing the power potential for WECs oscillating in different degrees of freedom, the results indicate the surging mode may be the most energetic; regardless of shapes and ocean sites. When applied to three generic WECs (point absorber, terminator, and attenuator), the pitching terminator is shown to have lower absorption potential. Finally, the mean annual energy production (MAEP) of the three generic WECs at WETS and PacWave are compared, and a surging attenuator shows a significant wave power potential at PacWave.},

The Power Take-Off (PTO) units that can provide power to the ocean (reactive power) are usually more expensive and complex. In this work, an optimal control formulation is presented using Pontryagin’s minimum principle that aims to maximize the harvested energy subject to constraints on the maximum PTO force and power flow direction. An analytical formulation is presented for the optimal control of an array of WECs, assuming irregular wave input. Three variations of the developed control are tested: a formulation without power constraints, a formulation that only allows for positive power, and finally, a formulation that allows for finite reactive power.

However the actual power take-off (PTO) impacts are barely considered in the WEC design. This paper highlights the demands of designing the WEC wave-to-wire control from a global point of view by studying the actual PTO impacts. A permanent magnet linear electrical machine (LEM) PTO unit is simulated and controlled to fulfill the WEC buoy control requirements. Several state of the art control algorithms, which include singular-arc (SA) control, shape-based (SB) control, model predictive control (MPC), and proportional-derivative (PD) control, are applied to maximize the wave energy production (mechanical energy). Multiple types of electrical PTOs, including ideal PTO, unlimited PTO and limited PTO, are all implemented to evaluate WEC wave-to-wire performances. Further, the PTO copper loss model and the PTO actual efficiency maps are introduced and studied to improve the electrical PTO operation efficiency. To further assess the control schemes in various wave conditions, one-year PacWave ground-truth data is applied as well. Numerical simulations are conducted using MATLAB/Simulink and the Simscape toolbox. The electrical PTO unit is composed of a LEM, an ideal inverter, and an ideal energy storage system. The results show that the actual PTO will impact the constrained controls (MPC and SB) less comapring to unconstrained controls (SA and PD). Although SB can produce the maximum energy with the limited PTOs, it is not robust for all wave conditions. At the end of the paper, the possible solutions for improving the WEC wave-to-wire performances are also provided.},

Specifically, the optimal linear limit cycle is defined as a second-order center in the phase plane projection of the constant energy orbit across the Hamiltonian surface. This concept of CCC described by a linear limit cycle constrained to a Hamiltonian surface will be extended to nonlinear limit cycles constrained to a Hamiltonian surface for maximum energy harvesting by the nonlinear WEC.

The proposed optimization method also presents the option of optimizing the system nonlinearities, such as those due to the buoy shape, such that the harvested energy is maximized. For the sake of control design, the control force and the system optimizable nonlinear force, each is expressed as a truncated power series function of the system states. The power series coefficients in both the control and system forces are optimized. A hidden genes genetic algorithm is used for optimization. The optimized system's nonlinear force is assumed to drive the design of the WEC. The numerical test cases presented in this paper show that it is possible to attain multiple fold higher harvested energy when using nonlinear control optimization. The advantage of being able to optimize the WEC design simultaneously with the control is the potential of harvesting this multiple fold higher energy without causing large WEC motion and with less dependence on reactive power. While this paper focuses on the optimization part of the problem, the implementation of the obtained control in realtime is discussed at the end of the paper.},

This paper presents an answer to this question. A class of nonlinear and linear plants for which MPC admits an analytical solution, is characterized. It is shown that for plants without directionality, constrained MPC can be identical to unconstrained MPC with saturation. Structural information on the characteristic (decoupling) matrix of a plant is often adequate for the characterization. Two input-constrained plant examples are considered. On the basis of structural information on the characteristic (decoupling) matrices of the two plants, the plan(s) for which constrained MPC admits an analytical solution is (are) specified.

	abstract = {With an increasing focus on climate action and energy security, an appropriate mix of renewable energy technologies is imperative. Despite having considerable global potential, wave energy has still not reached a state of maturity or economic competitiveness to have made an impact. Challenges include the high capital and operational costs associated with deployment in the harsh ocean environment, so it is imperative that the full energy harnessing capacity of wave energy devices, and arrays of devices in farms, is realised. To this end, control technology has an important role to play in maximising power capture, while ensuring that physical system constraints are respected, and control actions do not adversely affect device lifetime. Within the gamut of control technology, a variety of tools can be brought to bear on the wave energy control problem, including various control strategies (optimal, robust, nonlinear, etc.), data-based model identification, estimation, and forecasting. However, the wave energy problem displays a number of unique features which challenge the traditional application of these techniques, while also presenting a number of control ‘paradoxes’. This review articulates the important control-related characteristics of the wave energy control problem, provides a survey of currently applied control and control-related techniques, and gives some perspectives on the outstanding challenges and future possibilities. The emerging area of control co-design, which is especially relevant to the relatively immature area of wave energy system design, is also covered.},

A linearized model in the frequency domain is adopted to study the dynamics of such a two-body system with consideration of both the linear viscous damping and the hydrodynamic damping. The closed form solution of the maximum absorption power and corresponding power takeoff parameters are obtained. The suboptimal and optimal designs for a two-body system are proposed based on the closed form solution. The physical insight of the optimal design is to have one of the damped natural frequencies of the two body system the same as, or as close as possible to, the excitation frequency. A case study is conducted to investigate the influence of the submerged body on the absorption power of a two-body system subjected to suboptimal and optimal design under regular and irregular wave excitations. It is found that the absorption power of the two-body system can be significantly higher than that of the single body system with the same floating buoy in both regular and irregular waves. In regular waves, it is found that the mass of the submerged body should be designed with an optimal value in order to achieve the maximum absorption power for a given floating buoy in the presence of viscous damping. The viscous damping on the submerged body should be as small as possible for a given mass in both regular and irregular waves.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear, analytical wave-energy converter (WEC) models are generally simulated through time-domain (TD) numerical integration. However, the relatively high computational requirements of TD integration are not compatible with applications where a large number of simulations are needed. Spectral domain (SD) linearization has also been proposed to take into account some nonlinear effects, while being much faster than TD integration. However, as explained in this paper, such SD models have limited accuracy, and cannot extend to the static nonlinear forces. In this paper, a nonlinear frequency-domain (NLFD) method is investigated for WEC simulation, using a projection of the dynamical equations onto a basis of trigonometric functions. A comparison with TD integration (second-order Runge-Kutta-RK2) and SD methods is provided, through theoretical considerations, and by means of numerical simulations based on two case studies. In the cases considered, the proposed NLFD method allows for significant computational savings compared to RK2 integration, without requiring any approximation for the radiation forces. NLFD thus shows promising potential for applications involving extensive WEC simulation, such as power production assessment, while preserving the WEC model accuracy. Although slower than SD, NLFD has significant benefits in terms of accuracy and range of applicability.},

	abstract = {Analysis of wave-energy converters is most frequently undertaken in the time-domain. This formulation allows the direct inclusion of nonlinear time-varying loads such as power take-off (PTO) reactions, mooring forces, and viscous drag. However, integrating the governing equations of motion in the time domain is relatively computationally expensive, and requires a simulation to be conducted for each incident-wave state. In contrast, calculating the linearised performance of a wave energy converter (WEC) in sinusoidal waves of a given frequency is relatively inexpensive, albeit with the lower accuracy associated with the assumption of linearity. Combining this frequency-domain information with aspectral characterisation of the sea state therefore offers an opportunity to predict the power-capture performance of a WEC with less computational expense than a direct time-domain approach. In this regard, methods such as spectral domain linearisation (Folley, 2016) and nonlinear frequency domain analysis using a basis of trigonometric functions (Mérigaud and Ringwood, 2018) have been proposed to provide a compromise between speed and accuracy in assessments of WEC performance.This paper will compare time- and frequency-domain analyses of the Wavepiston surging-plate WEC. This device consists of a surging plate close to the free surface that drives a staged telescopic hydraulic PTO. Modelling this system in the frequency domain presents challenges associated withthe signiffcant nonlinear forces arising from both the PTO reactions and the non-negligible viscous drag acting on the plate. Equivalent linear damping coeffcients are used to model these forces in the frequency domain, while they are included explicitly in the time domain. The main idea of this paper is to quantify, for this device, the errors associated with linearising these two nonlinear processes. Ouraim here is to assess the trade-offs between speed and accuracy when using a fully-linear frequency-domain approach compared to a partially-nonlinear time-domain method},

Wave energy conversion is a technology especially suited for assisting in power generation in the offshore oil and gas platforms. A linear frequency domain model is created to predict the behavior of the heaving point absorber WEC system. The hydrodynamic parameters are obtained with AQWA, a software package based on boundary element methods. A linear external damping coefficient is applied to enable power absorption, and an external spring force is introduced to tune the point absorber to the incoming wave conditions. The external damping coefficient and external spring forces are the control parameters, which need to be optimized to maximize the power absorption. Two buoy shapes are tested and a variety of diameters and drafts are compared. Optimal shape, draft, and diameter of the model are then determined to maximize its power absorption capacity. Based on the results generated from the frequency domain analysis, a time domain analysis was also conducted to derive the responses of the WEC in the hydrodynamic time response domain. The time domain analysis results allowed us to estimate the power output of this WEC system.},

We performed a series of numerical simulation to analyze the hydrodynamic response and the power absorption performance of the system in regular waves. Overall, it was successful to use the RANS method to model the complex hydrodynamics interaction of the FPA system. We demonstrated the significance of the nonlinear effects, including viscous damping and wave overtopping. The study showed that the nonlinear effects could significantly decrease the power output and the motion of the FPA system, particularly in larger waves.},

While optimisation-based controllers can outperform non-optimisation based strategies, the computational requirements associated with numerical optimisation routines, and the high control forces required under optimal conditions, can render these energy-maximising control laws unsuitable for realistic scenarios. Non-optimisation-based controllers present an alternative solution, where linear time-invariant systems are used to approximate the so-called impedance-matching condition. These strategies are often simple to implement but suffer from performance degradation when motion constraints are considered. This paper aims to present a critical comparison between both families of controllers, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

In particular, we consider a 1/20th scale prototype of the ISWEC system, tested as part of a larger experimental campaign conducted within the tank facilities available at Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, subject to a variety of wave conditions. We adopt two different control structures to realise an approximation of the IM principle, fully tuned based upon interpolation of a particular (experimentally obtained) non-parametric empirical transfer function estimate, which defines the optimal frequency-domain input-output response for energy-maximising behaviour. Furthermore, a performance comparison between controller tuning based upon traditional linear boundary element method models, and the presented experimental approach, is also offered, showing that the latter can consistently outperform the former in realistic scenarios, for the set of analysed sea-states.},

	abstract = {Leading wind turbine manufacturers are racing to build larger and more powerful offshore machines. Drivetrain configurations often use a permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), in either a direct-drive configuration or coupled to a gearbox. With increasing demand for critical rare-earth magnets, new generator technologies are emerging to ensure a stable and secure supply chain. We evaluate three different topologies of radial flux synchronous generators employing high field magnets with reduced or no rare-earth content: a direct-drive interior PMSG (DD-IPMSG), a geared drivetrain combining a medium speed gearbox with a PMSG (MS-PMSG), and a direct-drive low-temperature superconducting generator (DD-LTSG). We develop a conceptual design module for each of these technologies within a larger framework for full turbine design. This provides the fairest comparison between technologies at nominal power ratings from 15–25MW, which represent the next generation of offshore wind turbines. The analyses show that if operational expenditures (OpEx) are constant across the technologies, MS-PMSG results in the lowest LCOE with reductions of up to 7\% relative to DD-IPMSG. DD-LTSG also yields lower LCOE values by 2\%–3\% for fixed-bottom turbines and 3\%–5\% with a floating platform. However, results are sensitive to OpEx assumptions, with a mere 10\% increase causing the conclusions to shift.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the fundamental principle of impedance-matching (IM) has inspired a number of sophisticated, yet simple, control solutions for wave energy converters (WEC). Such controllers have the capability of maximising energy absorption from incoming waves with mild computational requirements, being often intuitive in their design, hence especially appealing for real-time industrial applications. Nonetheless, these control solutions are, to date, almost exclusively developed for single degree-of-freedom (DoF) (and hence fully actuated) WEC systems, hindering their application to realistic underactuated multi-DoF devices, i.e. harvesting systems where energy is extracted from only a handful of its total set of modes of motion. Motivated by this, we present, in this paper, a comprehensive derivation and discussion of the IM conditions for maximum energy absorption in underactuated multi-DoF WEC systems. In particular, we show that the IM principle for single-DoF devices can be effectively extended to underactuated multi-DoF systems, and that a set of optimality conditions can be explicitly derived. In addition, we discuss both the impact and use of this set of optimal conditions for control design and synthesis, hence effectively taking a fundamental step towards the general extension of current IM-based techniques to the case of underactuated multi-DoF devices.},

	abstract = {Wave energy resources have high, yet largely untapped potential as candidate generation technology. In this paper, we perform a data-driven analysis to characterize the impact of wave energy integration on bulk-scale power systems and market operations. Through data-driven sensitivity studies centered on an optimization-based production cost modeling formulation, our work characterizes the inflection point beyond which wave integration starts impacting power system operations, considering present day transmission infrastructure. Furthermore, our analysis also considers the joint effects of wave energy integration and system-wide transmission expansion. Finally, potential resilience scenarios such as wildfire-driven transmission contingencies and heat wave events are investigated, whereby the contributions of grid-integrated wave energy in alleviating the effects of the resilience events are analyzed. As our demonstration test bed, we consider a reduced-order network topology for the U.S. Western Interconnection with wave energy generation integrated at carefully selected sites across the coastal areas of Washington, Oregon, and northern California. Our results indicate that over a representative year of operations, wave energy integration systematically reduces locational marginal prices (LMPs) of energy and price volatility, especially during periods of high wave resource availability (winter months for the U.S. west coast). Average, maximum, and minimum of hourly LMPs over a typical year of operation was reduced by 2.95, 51.28, and 1.13 \$/MWh respectively (over a baseline scenario with no wave energy integration), when the selected network model had a total of 5000 MW wave power installed capacity during the representative year of study. The effects of wave energy integration can remain localized with existing transmission infrastructure (identified to be most pronounced in the Pacific Northwest region in the example we studied). However, with concurrent transmission expansion, the impacts of wave energy integration are likely to have a higher geographical spread. Our results also indicate that wave energy may be able to assist power system operations during resilience events such as major transmission contingencies and heat wave events, although such benefits might be dependent on factors such as proximity of affected area to wave resources, availability of adequate resource potential and adequate transmission capacity.},

	abstract = {Climate change is driving the adoption of sustainable energy, with low-cost solar photovoltaics and wind power at the forefront. However, land-constrained regions and islands have a limited onshore renewable energy potential. Wave power may prove useful for such regions, supported by growing literature in the field. This study delves into wave power's techno-economic potential, addressing a gap in previous assessments focused solely on theoretical or technical prospects. Utilising hourly wave data and a wave energy converter manufacturer's power matrix, global wave electricity yield is estimated. Considering projected costs, levelised cost of electricity is used to gauge economic viability. Although wave power is currently expensive, the results suggest that it could become cost-competitive with offshore wind power in the 2030s, with levelised cost of electricity below 70 €/MWh by 2035 in areas with good wave energy resources. Finally, the paper contributes openly accessible, hourly capacity factor data of global wave power generation, empowering further energy system modelling research. This study paves the way for informed decision-making on wave power's role in a diversified, sustainable energy future.},

	abstract = {Ocean wave energy has the potential to play a crucial role in the shift to renewable energy. In order to improve wave energy conversion performance, it is necessary to break through the traditional sequential design process due to the coupling of subsystems such as the wave capture structure geometry, power take-off (PTO), and control systems. A co-design optimization is introduced in this paper to include effects of all subsystems with one outer and one inner optimization loop in order to reach a fully optimal design of an oscillating surge wave energy converter (OSWEC). A width and height sweep serves as an outer loop geometry optimization while power take-off components and control parameters are optimized efficiently in an inner loop for each geometry. An investigation into electrical power and mechanical power maximization also outlines the contrasting nature of the two objectives to illustrate the importance of electrical power maximization for identifying optimality. The co-design optimization leads to an optimal design with a width of 12 m and a height of 10 m which achieves an improvement in the normalized power value of over 60\% when compared to sequential design. A sensitivity analysis of the PTO system enhances understanding of the impact of PTO component value changes to support detailed-design of relevant components including drivetrain and generator. Lastly, the effect of the wave height and period on the optimal design is explored. Through the optimization and sensitivity analysis, a greater understanding on the effects of applying control co-design principles on surface piercing OSWECs is achieved and the importance of control co-design methods is demonstrated.},

API, USA, 1993.] for calculation of hydrodynamic loads on offshore truss structures is compared with the corresponding North Sea Design Practice, as given by the rules of Det Norske Veritas. Most emphasis is put on the hydrodynamic coefficients and the estimation of design current as these issues are identified to be particularly critical. Use of the updated API (1993) recommendations in which the drag coefficient for roughened cylinders is increased from a minimum of 0·6 (API 1991) to 1·05 (API 1993) and where current is included, could lead to a general increase in the estimated load level on slender offshore structures [Petrauskas, C., Heideman, J.C. \& Berek, E.P., Extreme wave force calculation procedure for the 20th edition of API RP 2A. OTC paper 7153, In Proc. OTC 1993, Houston, Texas, 1993, pp. 201–211]. The main emphasis with regard to the impact of the new API recommendations, however, is that a consistent approach is provided to the calculation of 100-yr directional loads. This includes taking into account the effect of marine growth on force coefficients, modifying the wave kinematics for directional spreading, and considering current blockage effects, conductor shielding effects, and joint occurrence of wave height and current (i.e., using the associated current as being representative of the current that would lead to the 100-yr load). It is concluded that a consistent approach, such as that underlying the new API RP 2A (1993) recipe, is preferable to the current North Sea Design Practice [Det Norske Veritas, Environmental conditions and environmental loads. DNV classification notes 30.5, 1001.] in this field, and thus that the North Sea Design Practice should be updated. This relates in particular to selection of hydrodynamic coefficients. Measurement programmes to obtain full scale global force data simultatneously with wave and current data are furthermore recommended.},

This method converts the wave energy absorption efficiency into the matching problem between the wave spectrum of the South China Sea and the buoy’s absorption power spectrum. An objective function which combines these two spectra is established to reflect the energy absorbing efficiency. By applying Taguchi design, the frequency domain hydrodynamic analysis and the response surface method (RSM), the radius, cone angle and draft of the buoy are optimized. Since the significant influence of power take-off system (PTO) on energy absorption, the optimal PTO damping under random wave conditions is also studied. The optimal shape is acquired by maximizing the energy absorbing efficiency. Four types of performance and the influence of each geometrical parameter are also obtained. In addition, the cause of the trend of performance as well as the effects of adjusting the input parameters are analyzed. This study can provide guidance for the shape optimization of multi-parameter buoys.},

	abstract = {A point-absorber wave-energy extractor is developed, consisting of a dual coaxial-cylinder system, with the inner cylinder tension-tethered and an outer cylinder (floater) oscillating vertically. A permanent magnet linear generator (PMLG) is used as a power take-off (PTO) capturing wave energy from the relative motion of the two cylinders. The mathematical modeling of the system includes the coupling effects of the cylinder hydrodynamics and the PMLG behavior. It gives a rational and effective way of providing performance predictions and directions for optimization. The flat bottom shape of the floater is modified into a needle-like curved shape to minimize viscous losses, which leads to three-times increase in floater response, compared with the flat-bottom geometry and thus improved wave-energy capture. The behavior of the PTO in the presence of an appropriate supporting structure for the coaxial cylinders are investigated, and optimal operating conditions for energy extraction and mechanical to electrical conversion efficiency are determined. Experimental results of this coupled system in regular waves confirm the validity of the theoretical predictions and soundness of the engineering design. Optimizing the floater bottom shape and the operating conditions for energy extraction lead to a two-times increase in overall efficiency, even without any active control.},

Only recently have sex and gender been thought of as separate concepts, and we have learned that sex (traditionally thought of as physical or biological) is as variable as gender (traditionally thought of as social). While trans people share many common experiences, there is immense diversity within trans communities. There are an estimated 700,000 transgendered individuals in the US and 15 million worldwide. Even still, there's been a notable lack of organized information for this sizable group.

Inspired by Our Bodies, Ourselves, the classic and powerful compendium written for and by women, Trans Bodies, Trans Selves is widely accessible to the transgender population, providing authoritative information in an inclusive and respectful way and representing the collective knowledge base of dozens of influential experts. Each chapter takes the reader through an important transgender issue, such as race, religion, employment, medical and surgical transition, mental health topics, relationships, sexuality, parenthood, arts and culture, and many more. Anonymous quotes and testimonials from transgender people who have been surveyed about their experiences are woven throughout, adding compelling, personal voices to every page.

We explore barriers to AAC use, including a lack of awareness of relevant options, misconceptions about who AAC supports are for, and the cost of dedicated AAC applications or devices. We then provide suggestions for autistic adults, people supporting autistic adults, and researchers. Overall communication—rather than speech—should be prioritized. Mainstream communication technologies can support communication for autistic adults and a variety of tools can support communication across contexts.

The PTO force is controlled by a machine side back-to-back voltage source converter (VSC), which is connected to a constant DC-link voltage. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is then used to maximise the absorbed electrical power with the resistive losses of the PTO included; this is compared with classical control methods. The optimal force produced from the MPC incorporates legitimate physical and electrical constraints of the WEC and LPMG -the importance of including such constraints within the optimisation is shown. Field weakening and a uni-directional power flow constraint are then incorporated to help prevent poor grid power quality when fluctuations in the DC-link occur. It is assumed that the constrained optimal control approach produces the highest possible electrical power available.

To fill this gap, this paper provides an insight into how PTO sizing affects the performance of linear permanent magnet (PM) generators, and further the techno-economic performance of WECs. To thoroughly reveal the power production of the WEC, both hydrodynamic modeling and generator modeling are incorporated. In addition, three different methods for sizing the linear generator are applied and compared. The effect of the selection of the sizing method on the techno-economic performance of the WEC is identified. Furthermore, to realistically reflect the relevance of PTO sizing, wave resources from three European sea sites are considered in the techno-economic analysis. The dependence of PTO sizing on wave resources is demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Multifidelity design optimization is a strategy that can reduce the high computational cost in cases where the high-fidelity model is too expensive to use directly in optimization. However, current multifidelity approaches cannot handle the high-dimensional problems commonly encountered in industrial settings. Furthermore, they cannot accommodate arbitrary analysis fidelities, directly handle multidisciplinary problems, or provably converge to the high-fidelity optimum. In this paper, we present a practical multifidelity approach that leverages the advantages of conventional gradient-based approaches. Rather than constructing a multifidelity surrogate, we perform a sequence of single-fidelity gradient-based optimizations. The framework determines the appropriate fidelity and updates it during the optimization process. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed approach on a multipoint aerostructural wing optimization problem with over a hundred design variables. The multifidelity approach reduces the computational cost by 59\% compared to the high-fidelity approach while obtaining the same numerical optimum.},

	abstract = {The theory of automatic control has been advanced in important ways during recent years, particularly with respect to stability and optimal control. These are significant contributions which appeal to many workers, including the writers, because they answer important questions and are both theoretically elegant and practically useful. These theories do not, however, lay to rest all questions of importance to the control engineer. The designer of the attitude control system for a space vehicle booster which, for simplicity, utilizes a rate-switched engine gimbal drive, must know the characteristics of the limit cycle oscillation that the system will sustain and must have some idea of how the system will respond to attitude commands while continuing to limit-cycle. The designer of a chemical process control system must be able to predict the transient oscillations the process may experience during start-up due to the limited magnitudes of important variables in the system. The designer of a radar antenna pointing system with limited torque capability must be able to predict the rms pointing error due to random wind disturbances on the antenna, and must understand how these random disturbances will influence the behavior of the system in its response to command inputs. But more important than just being able to evaluate how a given system will behave in a postulated situation is the fact that these control engineers must design their systems to meet specifications on important characteristics. Thus a complicated exact analytical tool, if one existed, would be of less value to the designer than an approximate tool which is simple enough in application to give insight into the trends in system behavior as a function of system parameter values or possible compensations, hence providing the basis for system design. As an analytical tool to answer questions such as these in a way …},

The purpose of this scoping review was to (a) identify the facilitators and barriers to AAC provision for this group of individuals, (b) discuss observable trends throughout studies, and (c) highlight areas for further research in AAC for this group of learners. This review compiles the results from seven studies within the last 10 years and focuses on the facilitators and barriers when implementing AAC systems for DHH individuals with a disability (DWD) and complex communication needs. The facilitators and barriers are categorised as interpersonal, intervention and assessment related. The trends that were identified included (a) the overall success of AAC, (b) the prevalence of speech-generating devices (SGD) use, (c) the lack of communication within interdisciplinary teams, (d) the lack of DHH-specific research, and (e) the lack of standardised methods for AAC selection.},

	abstract = {For families and educators, understanding and working with children who experience a combination of deafness and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be challenging. Yet both understanding and work are crucial. For children with ASD to succeed, parents and educators need to understand them and to be able to work together to implement successful educational strategies. These strategies fall into two categories: 1) strategies for improving social interaction, primarily focusing on communication; and 2) strategies for incorporating the students' interests, which may be intense but restricted (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). What this means is that some children can be very focused on a few specific interests so educators can modify strategies to use each child's interests to introduce new knowledge and teach various skills. Educators, must develop a "toolbox" of strategies and frameworks of practice to help students develop supportive relationships and ensure they have a sense of belonging and being a part of an inclusive community. The information in this toolbox will help teachers who have deaf or hard of hearing children with ASD in their classrooms. This article describes four strategies that are inclusive; they work for most children. They include: (1) routine explanation; (2) video modeling; (3) peer-to-peer social interaction; and (4) differentiated instruction.},

	abstract = {Wave energy is a continuously available resource with tremendous potential. However, utility-scale wave energy harvesting has experienced limited commercial success to date. Many of these shortcomings can be attributed to the fundamental mismatch between the low-frequency nature of ocean waves and the physical principles of conventional electromagnetic generators used in today's WECs, leading to WECs that are large, expensive, and inefficient. As such, a growing number of researchers are investigating electric machinery based on electrostatics as a viable alternative for WEC generators. Not only are electrostatic WECs generally more efficient than their electromagnetic counterparts at low-speed operation, but they also tend to be constructed from abundant, lightweight, and inexpensive materials, which could make WECs economically competitive with other energy sources. This paper first characterizes electrostatic WECs from a theoretical perspective to gain insight into their physical nature and then reviews existing electrostatic WEC technologies, which include variable-capacitance and triboelectric generators. Performance metrics for existing electrostatic WECs are presented. Finally, the key challenges in electrostatic WEC technology are identified along with several strategies to overcome these hurdles in future research.},

Almost all the existing relevant review paper focus on electrical generator with the working principle of electromagnetic induction or piezoelectric or triboelectric effect. In this paper, all the existing types (based on principle of operation) of electrical generator used for wave power harvesting are discussed. This paper not only covers recent progress in electrical power generation by electro-magnetic induction, piezoelectric generator, and electrostatic induction, but also presents critical comparative review as well where suitable use and weakness of each type of generators are discussed. Moreover, the application of advanced magnetic core, winding, and permanent magnets are discussed with extensive explanation which are not focused in the existing reviews. Various new constructional features of the electrical generators such as split translator flux switching, two-point absorber, triangular coil, dual port linear generator, piezoelectric, triboelectric nanogenerator, etc. are highlighted with principles of operation. It also includes emerging human intervened optimization method for determining optimum shape of generator and cooling system which is necessary to prevent demagnetization of the permanent magnet. Finally, the way of supply the generated electrical power form the generator to load/grid is thoroughly described in a separate section that would be obvious for successful operation. The comparison among all types of generators in terms of output voltage, current, scale of power production, power-frequency characteristics, power density, cascading, and approaches are tabulated in this paper.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the emerging trends in the development of electrical generators for large wind turbines. To describe the developments in the design of electrical generators, it is necessary to look at the conversion system as a whole, and then, the structural and mechanical performances of the drive train need to be considered. Many drive train configurations have been proposed for large wind turbines; they should ensure high reliability, long availability and reduced maintainability. Although most installed wind turbines are geared, directly driven wind turbines with permanent magnet generators have attracted growing interest in the last few years, which has been in parallel to the continuous increase of the per unit turbine power. The aim of this work is to present the recent commercial designs of electrical generators in large wind turbines. Both the strengths and weaknesses of the existing systems are discussed. The most emerging technologies in high-power, low-speed electrical generators are investigated. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of different electrical generator concepts is performed, and the generators are assessed upon a list of criteria such as the mass, cost, and mass-to-torque ratio. Within the framework of these criteria, it may help to determine whether the electrical generator is technically feasible and economically viable for high-power wind turbines. Finally, this review could help to determine suitable generators for use in large and ultra-large wind energy systems.},

Given these characteristics, against the backdrop of the energy maximising control problem for Wave Energy Converters (WECs), with physical constraints on system variables and a non-causal optimal control solution it is, perhaps, natural to consider the application of MPC to the WEC problem. However, the WEC energy maximisation problem requires a significant modification of the traditional MPC objective function, resulting in a potentially non-convex optimisation problem. A variety of MPC formulations for WECs have been proposed, with variations in the WEC model, discretisation method, objective function and optimisation algorithm employed. This paper attempts to provide a critical comparison of the various WEC MPC algorithms, while also presenting WEC MPC algorithms within the broader context of other WEC “optimal” control schemes.},

	abstract = {For high-precision motion systems, modelling and control design specifically oriented at friction effects is instrumental. The sinusoidal input describing function theory represents an approximative mathematical framework for analysing non-linear system behaviour. This theory, however, limits the description of the non-linear system behaviour to a quasi-linear amplitude-dependent relation between sinusoidal excitation and sinusoidal response. In this paper, an extension to higher-order describing functions is realised by introducing the concept of the harmonics generator. The resulting higher-order sinusoidal input describing functions (HOSIDFs) relate the magnitude and phase of the higher harmonics of the periodic response of the system to the magnitude and phase of a sinusoidal excitation. Based on this extension two techniques to measure HOSIDFs are presented. The first technique is FFT based. The second technique is based on IQ (in-phase/quadrature-phase) demodulation. In a simulation, the measurement techniques have been tested by comparing the simulation results to analytically derived results from a known (backlash) non-linearity. In a subsequent practical case study both techniques are used to measure the changes in dynamic behaviour as a function of drive level due to friction in an electric motor. Both methods prove successful for measuring HOSIDFs.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The open-source WecOptTool was developed to make wave energy converter (WEC) control co-design accessible. WecOptTool is based on the pseudo-spectral method which is capable of efficiently dealing with any linear or nonlinear constraints and nonlinear dynamics by solving the WEC optimal control problem in the time domain using a gradient based optimization algorithm. This work1 presents a control co-optimization study of the AquaHarmonics Inc. heaving point absorber WEC sized for ocean deployment to solve practical industry design problems. Components such as the specific type of generator, the hull shape, and the displaced volume are pre-determined. We co-optimize the WEC’s mass versus mooring line pretension in conjunction with the controller. The optimization is subject to the power-take-off (PTO) dynamics and the rated constraints of the components. In particular, the continuous torque rating is implemented as an explicit constraint, a novel approach for WEC optimization. The PTO dynamics are incorporated into the optimization algorithm via a combination of first principle methods (linear drivetrain model) and empirical efficiency maps (electrical generator) represented as a power loss map. This is a practical method applicable to a variety of PTO architectures and transferable to other WECs. A discussion between using an efficiency coefficient versus a power loss map and their implication for the optimization method is presented. This application of WecOptTool represents a real world WEC by combining simplified models with empirical efficiency data. The WEC, as a dynamically coupled, oscillatory system, requires consideration of the time trajectory dependent power loss for optimizing the average electrical power. This objective function, the modelling approach, and the realistic loss terms makes the common practice of artificially penalizing the reactive power needless.},

	abstract = {Most wave energy devices are subject to finite constraints on both the power take-off (PTO) stroke length and the maximum force that the PTO can tolerate. It is also often the case that greater stroke lengths can reduce the maximum force in the PTO and vice versa. Ultimately, some informed choice of PTO constraints must be made in order to ensure that PTO constraints are not violated and that the trade-off between position and force constraints is made in such as way that maximum energy is captured by the converter. This paper presents a tool to allow device developers to check the satisfaction of constraints for a given hydrodynamic model and set of sea conditions and, where constraints are not satisfied, shows how to relax the constraints to maximize energy capture. The tool is algebraic, requiring no simulation and the results are presented through intuitive geometrical constructs. Sample application results are presented for single- and two-body wave energy systems.},

	abstract = {The paper deals with the stochastic optimal control of a wave energy point absorber with strong nonlinear buoyancy forces using the reactive force from the electric generator on the absorber as control force. The considered point absorber has only one degree of freedom, heave motion, which is used to extract energy. Constrains are enforced on the control force to prevent large structural stresses in the floater at specific hot spots with the risk of inducing fatigue damage, or because the demanded control force cannot be supplied by the actuator system due to saturation. Further, constraints are enforced on the motion of the floater to prevent it from hitting the bottom of the sea or to make unacceptable jumps out of the water. The applied control law, which is of the feedback type with feedback from the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the floater, contains two unprovided gain parameters, which are chosen so the mean (expected value) of the power outtake in the stationary state is optimized. In order to ensure accuracy of the results for each configuration of the controller Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out for various sea-states and the final results have been presented in the paper. The effect of nonlinear buoyancy force – in comparison to linear buoyancy force – and constraints of the controller on the power outtake of the device have been studied in details and supported by numerical simulations.},

Based on these estimates a set of power performance measures that can be related to costs are derived. These are the absorbed energy per characteristic mass [kWh/kg], per characteristic surface area [MWh/m2], and per root mean square of Power Take Off (PTO) force [kWh/N]. The methodology relies on numerical modelling. For each device, a numerical Wave-to-Wire (W2W) model is built based on the equations of motion. Physical effects are modelled according to the state-of-the-art within hydrodynamic modelling practise. Then, the W2W models are used to calculate the power matrices of each device and the mean annual power absorption at five different representative wave sites along the European Coast, at which the mean level of wave power resource ranges between 15 and 88 kW per metre of wave front. Uncertainties are discussed and estimated for each device. Computed power matrices and results for the mean annual power absorption are assembled in a summary sheet per device. Comparisons of the selected devices show that, despite very different working principles and dimensions, power performance measures vary much less than the mean annual power absorption. With the chosen units, these measures are all shown to be of the order of 1.},

This WEC subsystem converts the hydrodynamic excitation of the WEC into useful mechanical and, typically, electrical energy. It is well known that WEC control systems have the capability to significantly enhance the performance of WECs, but are limited in scope by the physical PTO displacement and force constraints. A variety of WEC control algorithms have the capacity to include the PTO constraints within the (constrained) optimal control formulation, delivering performance which takes maximum advantage of the available operational space, but avoiding exceedance of device/PTO specifications. However, little consideration is given to the interplay between the constraint levels and the maximum achievable performance. This paper examines, from an economic perspective, the trade-off between energy receipts and the capital cost of force and displacement constraints in a typical heaving point absorber WEC.},

	abstract = {The absorber is known to be vertical axisymmetric for a single-point wave energy converter (WEC). The shape of the wetted surface usually has a great influence on the absorber’s hydrodynamic characteristics which are closely linked with the wave power conversion ability. For complex wetted surface, the hydrodynamic coefficients have been predicted traditionally by hydrodynamic software based on the BEM. However, for a systematic study of various parameters and geometries, they are too multifarious to generate so many models and data grids. This paper examines a semi-analytical method of decomposing the complex axisymmetric boundary into several ring-shaped and stepped surfaces based on the boundary discretization method (BDM) which overcomes the previous difficulties. In such case, by using the linear wave theory based on eigenfunction expansion matching method, the expressions of velocity potential in each domain, the added mass, radiation damping and wave excitation forces of the oscillating absorbers are obtained. The good astringency of the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave forces are obtained for various geometries when the discrete number reaches a certain value. The captured wave power for a same given draught and displacement for various geometries are calculated and compared. Numerical results show that the geometrical shape has great effect on the wave conversion performance of the absorber. For absorbers with the same outer radius and draught or displacement, the cylindrical type shows fantastic wave energy conversion ability at some given frequencies, while in the random sea wave, the parabolic and conical ones have better stabilization and applicability in wave power conversion.},

The WEC chosen for this study is a two-body self-referenced heaving device characterised using a boundary element method (BEM) numerical model run in time-domain and accounting for some non-linearities. The model also includes power take-off capping, in terms of power capacity and a force cap, independently. A novel metric is introduced to assess the shape similarity between two spectra and it is used to assess the impact of approximating raw spectra with standard ones on energy production estimates. The study shows that the power take-off capping approaches and values and the way the exact resource spectra are approximated have a significant impact WEC energy estimation methods accuracy. Indeed, relative differences in yearly production estimates with respect to the benchmark method vary from 2.4\% to 8.3\% across capping values and estimation methods. It also shows that there is little difference in yearly averaged energy production estimates between the different “matrix based” methods. These differences are of the order of tens of percent for a given power take-off capping configuration and a given site.},

The diagrams show both data and process flow through the multidisciplinary system and computational elements, which facilitate the understanding of the various architectures, and how they relate to each other.

	abstract = {While a great deal of research has been performed to quantify and characterize the wave energy resource, there are still open questions about how a wave energy developer should use this wave resource information to design a wave energy converter device to suit a specific environment or, alternatively, to assess potential deployment locations. It is natural to focus first on the impressive magnitudes of power available from ocean waves, and to be drawn to locations where mean power levels are highest. However, a number of additional factors such as intermittency and capacity factor may be influential in determining economic viability of a wave energy converter, and should therefore be considered at the resource level, so that these factors can influence device design decisions. This study examines a set of wave resource metrics aimed towards this end of bettering accounting for variability in wave energy converter design. The results show distinct regional trends that may factor into project siting and wave energy converter design. Although a definitive solution for the optimal size of a wave energy converter is beyond the reaches of this study, the evidence presented does support the idea that smaller devices with lower power ratings may merit closer consideration.},

	abstract = {Discrete-continuous optimization problems are commonly modeled in algebraic form as mixed-integer linear or nonlinear programming models. Since these models can be formulated in different ways, leading either to solvable or nonsolvable problems, there is a need for a systematic modeling framework that provides a fundamental understanding on the nature of these models. This work presents a modeling framework, generalized disjunctive programming (GDP), which represents problems in terms of Boolean and continuous variables, allowing the representation of constraints as algebraic equations, disjunctions and logic propositions. An overview is provided of major research results that have emerged in this area. Basic concepts are emphasized as well as the major classes of formulations that can be derived. These are illustrated with a number of examples in the area of process systems engineering. As will be shown, GDP provides a structured way for systematically deriving mixed-integer optimization models that exhibit strong continuous relaxations, which often translates into shorter computational times. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 59: 3276–3295, 2013},

Multiple linearized models derived from aeroelastic simulation software in different operating regions characterized by the incoming wind speed are combined to construct an approximate low-fidelity model of the system. The combined model is then used to generate open-loop, optimal control trajectories as part of a nested control co-design strategy that explores the system's power production and stability using the platform pitch tilt as a proxy in the context of crucial plant and control design decisions. The radial distance between the central and outer columns and the diameter of the outer columns of the semisubmersible platform are the plant design variables. The platform stability and power production are studied for different plant design decisions. The effect of plant decisions on subsequent power production and stability response of the floating wind turbine is quantified in terms of the levelized cost of energy. The results show that the inner-loop constraints and the plant design decisions affect the turbine's power and, subsequently, the cost of the system.},

The previous work in co-design theory imposed restrictions on the type of problems that could be posed. This paper lifts many of those restrictions. The problem formulations and optimality conditions for both the simultaneous and nested solution strategies are given. Due to a number of challenges associated with the optimality conditions, practical solution considerations are discussed with a focus on the motivating reasons for using direct transcription (DT) in co-design. This paper highlights some of the key concepts in general co-design including general coupling, the differences between the feasible regions for each strategy, general boundary conditions, inequality path constraints, system-level objectives, and the complexity of the closed-form solutions. Three co-design test problems are provided. A number of research directions are proposed to further co-design theory including tailored solution methods for reducing total computational expense, better comparisons between the two solution strategies, and more realistic test problems.},

Similar to the case of axially symmetric absorbers, the maximum power extracted is shown to be directly proportional to the incident wave characteristics: energy flux, angle of incidence and wavelength. Accordingly, the capture width ratio is directly proportional to the wavelength, thus giving a design estimate of the maximum efficiency of the system. We then compare the array and the single gate in terms of energy production.

We propose a scientifically rigorous framework to find realistic optimal geometries of wave energy converters (WECs). For specificity, we assume WECs to be axisymmetric point absorbers in a monochromatic unidirectional incident wave, all within the context of linearised potential theory. We consider separately the problem of a WEC moving and extracting wave energy in heave only and then the more general case of motion and extraction in combined heave, surge and pitch. We describe the axisymmetric geometries using polynomial basis functions, allowing for discontinuities in slope. Our framework involves ensuring maximum power, specifying practical motion constraints and then minimising surface area (as a proxy for cost). The framework is robust and well-posed, and the optimisation produces feasible WEC geometries. Using the proposed framework, we develop a systematic computational and theoretical approach, and we obtain results and insights for the optimal WEC geometries. The optimisation process is sped up significantly by a new theoretical result to obtain roots of the heave resonance equation. For both the heave-only, and the heave-surge-pitch combined problems, we find that geometries which protrude outward below the waterline are generally optimal. These optimal geometries have up to 73 \% less surface area and 90 \% less volume than the optimal cylinders which extract the same power.},

An incident plane wave is expanded in Bessel functions and for each mode the problem is formulated in terms of the radial displacement on the cylindrical interface below the cylinder. The solution is obtainable either from an infinite set of simultaneous equations or from an integral equation. It is shown that the phase of the solution is independent of depth and resonances are found at wave-numbers close to those of free oscillations in a cylinder extending to the bottom. If the resonances of the cylinder are made sharper (by increasing the depth of immersion) the peak response of the harbour increases, but the response to a continuous spectrum remains approximately constant. Numerical results are obtained by minimizing the least squares error of a finite number N of simultaneous equations. Convergence is slow, but the error is roughly proportional to 1/N and this is exploited. The solution obtained from a variational formulation using the incoming wave as a trial function is found to give a very good approximation for small wave-numbers, but is increasingly inaccurate for large wave-numbers. Away from resonance the amplitude of the harbour oscillation is less than 10\% of the amplitude of the incoming wave provided the depth of the cylinder is greater than about ¼ wavelength, and it is argued that in practice at the resonant wave-number oscillations excited through the bottom of the harbour will leak out through the entrance before they can reach large amplitudes. In an appendix the excitation of harbour oscillations through the harbour entrance is discussed, and some results of Miles \& Munk (1961) on an alleged harbour paradox are re-interpreted.},

Irregular waves based on the Bretschneider wave spectrum are considered. The optimization problem was solved using a pseudospectral method, a direct optimal control approach that can incorporate practical design constraints, such as power flow, actuation force, and slamming. The results provide early-stage guidelines for WEC design. Results show the resonance frequency required for optimal energy production with a regular wave is quite different than the resonance frequency found for irregular waves; specifically, it is much higher.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe a procedure to maximize the power-to-load ratio of a novel wave energy converter (WEC) that combines an oscillating surge wave energy converter with variable structural components. The control of the power-take-off torque will be on a wave-to-wave timescale, whereas the structure will be controlled statically such that the geometry remains the same throughout the wave period. Linear hydrodynamic theory is used to calculate the upper and lower bounds for the time-averaged absorbed power and surge foundation loads while assuming that the WEC motion remains sinusoidal. Previous work using pseudo-spectral techniques to solve the optimal control problem focused solely on maximizing absorbed energy. This work extends the optimal control problem to include a measure of the surge foundation force in the optimization. The objective function includes two competing terms that force the optimizer to maximize power capture while minimizing structural loads. A penalty weight was included with the surge foundation force that allows control of the optimizer performance based on whether emphasis should be placed on power absorption or load shedding. Results from pseudo-spectral optimal control indicate that a unit reduction in time-averaged power can be accompanied by a greater reduction in surge-foundation force.},

In this study we have evaluated the role of LDES in decarbonized electricity systems and identified the cost and efficiency performance necessary for LDES to substantially reduce electricity costs and displace firm low-carbon generation. Our findings show that energy storage capacity cost and discharge efficiency are the most important performance parameters. Charge/discharge capacity cost and charge efficiency play secondary roles. Energy capacity costs must be ≤US\$20 kWh–1 to reduce electricity costs by ≥10\%. With current electricity demand profiles, energy capacity costs must be ≤US\$1 kWh–1 to fully displace all modelled firm low-carbon generation technologies. Electrification of end uses in a northern latitude context makes full displacement of firm generation more challenging and requires performance combinations unlikely to be feasible with known LDES technologies. Finally, LDES systems with the greatest impact on electricity cost and firm generation have storage durations exceeding 100 h.},

While various MDO software frameworks exist, none of them take full advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms to solve coupled models efficiently. Furthermore, there is a need to facilitate the computation of the derivatives of these coupled models for use with gradient-based optimization algorithms to enable design with respect to large numbers of variables. In this paper, we present the theory and architecture of OpenMDAO, an open-source MDO framework that uses Newton-type algorithms to solve coupled systems and exploits problem structure through new hierarchical strategies to achieve high computational efficiency. OpenMDAO also provides a framework for computing coupled derivatives efficiently and in a way that exploits problem sparsity. We demonstrate the framework’s efficiency by benchmarking scalable test problems. We also summarize a number of OpenMDAO applications previously reported in the literature, which include trajectory optimization, wing design, and structural topology optimization, demonstrating that the framework is effective in both coupling existing models and developing new multidisciplinary models from the ground up. Given the potential of the OpenMDAO framework, we expect the number of users and developers to continue growing, enabling even more diverse applications in engineering analysis and design.},

	abstract = {Marine energy technologies convert the energy of ocean waves, and tidal, river, and ocean currents into electricity and other forms of usable energy. The marine energy resource potential in the United States is significant and geographically diverse, with a study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy estimating that the nation’s annual marine energy potential is approximately 2,300 TWh/year across the 50 states, or greater than 57 percent of U.S. electricity generation in 2019. However, the marine energy industry still faces hurdles to commercialization. While high costs relative to wind and solar remain a key challenge, other hurdles relate to marine energy’s value streams not being well characterized and not captured by traditional energy comparison metrics like the levelized cost of energy. To address this challenge, this project undertakes several types of analyses to identify and illustrate value propositions for marine energy resources. It provides a fresh framework for considering electric system benefits based on unique marine energy attributes, and provides analyses illustrating and quantifying those benefits. The authors find many opportunities for the deployment of marine energy technologies both in the near term and within typical utility planning timeframes (i.e. up to 20 years). From a resource and technology perspective, marine energy resources can deliver distinct and valuable benefits to different configurations of the grid, whether the bulk system, isolated distribution systems, or remote communities, islands, and microgrids. Marine energy resources can be valuable in increasing technology diversity in a generation portfolio, providing energy where it is otherwise difficult to come by, supporting local resiliency, complementing and being complemented by other resources including solar, wind, and energy storage, and avoiding land constraints.},

Traditionally, levelized cost of energy has been considered the ultimate stage gate through which wave energy developers must pass in order to find success (i.e., the levelized cost of wave energy must be less than that of solar and wind). However, real world energy decisions are not based solely on levelized cost of energy. In this study, we consider the energy mix in California in the year 2045, upon which the state plans to achieve zero carbon energy production. By considering temporal electricity production and consumption, we are able to perform a more informed analysis of the decision process to address this challenge. The results show that, due to high level of ocean wave energy in the winter months, wave energy provides a valuable complement to solar and wind, which have higher production in the summer. Thus, based on this complementary temporal aspect, wave energy appears cost-effective, even when the cost of installation and maintenance is twice that of solar and wind.},

Because the authors' primary area of expertise is in the structures discipline, the majority of the references focus on the interaction of this discipline with others.

	abstract = {Geothermal systems making use of advanced drilling and well stimulation techniques have the potential to provide tens to hundreds of gigawatts of clean electricity generation in the United States by 2050. With near-zero variable costs, geothermal plants have traditionally been envisioned as providing “baseload” power, generating at their maximum rated output at all times. However, as variable renewable energy sources (VREs) see greater deployment in energy markets, baseload power is becoming increasingly less competitive relative to flexible, dispatchable generation and energy storage. Herein we conduct an analysis of the potential for future geothermal plants to provide both of these services, taking advantage of the natural properties of confined, engineered geothermal reservoirs to store energy in the form of accumulated, pressurized geofluid and provide flexible load-following generation. We develop a linear optimization model based on multi-physics reservoir simulations that captures the transient pressure and flow behaviors within a confined, engineered geothermal reservoir. We then optimize the investment decisions and hourly operations of a power plant exploiting such a reservoir against a set of historical and modeled future electricity price series. We find that operational flexibility and in-reservoir energy storage can significantly enhance the value of geothermal plants in markets with high VRE penetration, with energy value improvements of up to 60\% relative to conventional baseload plants operating under identical conditions. Across a range of realistic subsurface and operational conditions, our modeling demonstrates that confined, engineered geothermal reservoirs can provide large and effectively free energy storage capacity, with round-trip storage efficiencies comparable to those of leading grid-scale energy storage technologies. Optimized operational strategies indicate that flexible geothermal plants can provide both short- and long-duration energy storage, prioritizing output during periods of high electricity prices. Sensitivity analysis assesses the variation in outcomes across a range of subsurface conditions and cost scenarios.},

The energy transition towards a preponderant green energy economy requires innovative solutions to enhance the power grid economic dispatches looking for a better allocation of the energy demand among the diverse renewable and fossil fuel energy plants. Green renewable energy systems must be preferred over fossil fuel generators when they are available. However, fossil plants are still required to be kept operational due to the variability and uncertainty of renewable energy plants. This study proposes a hybrid rational economic dispatch model that combines a cost minimization linear model enhanced with a fuzzy logic system for decision-making on wind and hydropower minimum and maximum generation levels. The model considers the intermittency of wind energy and recognizes the strategic value of hydropower as energy storage. The results of the model with real data taken from wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, nuclear, bioenergy, and fossil fuel power plants in the eastern region of Mexico show that a fairer, rational, and cost-optimized power grid economic dispatch can be achieved with the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Dynamic economic dispatch of a microgrid is better suited to the requirements of a system in actual operation because it not only considers the lowest cost in a scheduling cycle but also coordinates between different distribution generations (DGs) over many periods. So it is very significant to research the dynamic economic dispatch of a microgrid. Since wind energy and solar energy are subject to random variations and intervals, there is great difficulty in solving the dynamic economic dispatch. In this paper, we establish a combined heat and power (CHP) microgrid system which includes wind turbines (WT), photovoltaic arrays (PV), diesel engines (DE), a micro-turbine (MT), a fuel cell (FC) and a battery (BS). Comprehensively considering the operation cost and the pollutant treatment cost of the microgrid system, we choose the maximum comprehensive benefits as the objective function for the dynamic economic dispatch. At the same time, we establish the spinning reserve probability constraints of the microgrid considering the influence of uncertainty factors such as the fluctuation of the renewable energy, load fluctuation error, and fault shutdown of the unit. Also researched are four different operation scheduling strategies under grid-connected mode and island mode of the microgrid. An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm combined with Monte Carlo simulation is used to solve the objective function. With the example system, the proposed models and improved algorithm are verified. When the microgrid is running under the grid-connected mode, we discuss the influence of different scheduling strategies, optimization goals and reliability indexes on the dynamic economic dispatch. And when the microgrid is running under the island mode, we discuss the influence of the uncertainty factors and the capacityof the battery on the dynamic economic dispatch. The presented research can provide some reference for dynamic economic dispatch of microgrid on making full use of renewable energy and improving the microgrid system reliability.},

However, there has been little consideration of the credibility of the learning curve. The current trend that many important energy and climate change policy analyses rely on the learning curve means that it is of great importance to critically examine the basis for learning curves. Here, we analyse the use of learning curves in energy technology, usually implemented as a simple power function. We find that the learning curve cannot separate the effects of price and technological change, cannot reflect continuous and qualitative change of both conventional and emerging energy technologies, cannot help to determine the time paths of technological investment, and misses the central role of R\&D activity in driving technological change. We argue that a logistic curve of improving performance modified to include R\&D activity as a driving variable can better describe the cost reductions in energy technologies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the top-down Leontief technology can incorporate the bottom-up technologies that improve along either the learning curve or the logistic curve, through changing input–output coefficients. An application to UK wind power illustrates that the logistic curve fits the observed data better and implies greater potential for cost reduction than the learning curve does.},

	title = {A {Set}-{Based} {Design} approach for the design of high-performance wave energy converters},
	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to introduce an approach for designing wave energy converters (WECs) that can be implemented early during the conceptual design phase, enabling downstream convergence on higher performance concepts. Currently, WEC concepts span a wide design space which includes a high number of functionally dissimilar devices. The concept-agnostic assessment of WEC techno-economic performance, the Technology Performance Level (TPL) metric [1], provides designers with a set of customer requirements upon which devices can be assessed. Those requirements were translated to functional requirements using a systems engineering approach [2]. Despite the framework that TPL and the functional requirements provide, WEC designers have limited guidance in approach to conceptual design. This often results in premature commitment to a single functional concept that can limit device performance, even if later-stage design optimization techniques are used [3]. TPL has made significant strides in helping designers understand the requirements of WEC design. This work aims to guide designers toward design processes which can help them meet those requirements. This paper proposes a Set-Based Design approach to WEC conceptual design which could enable the generation of high-performance concepts faster and with less expense. Set-Based Design is a design process in which engineers ideate a large set of potential solutions and work with critical stakeholders to ensure convergence on an optimal concept [4]. The process was chosen specifically due to its ability to directly facilitate design decision making. We tested the design method through a design workshop in which participants were given design requirements and asked to generate WEC concepts. Though the workshop was constrained by time, number of participants, and background of participants, it was a good proof of concept for the applicability of this design methodology and provided insight on how to continue developing WEC design methodologies. SBD is a methodology that can help designers understand and design to the conflicting requirements of WEC design. SBD also allows designers to avoid making decisions based on imprecise information, which may ultimately lead to more efficient generation of
high-performance concepts.},

	abstract = {The design space for ocean wave energy converters is notable for its divergence. To facilitate convergence, and thereby support commercialization, we present a new simple method for analysis and comparison of alternative device architectures at an early stage of the design process. Using Thévenin's theorem, Falnes crafted an ingenious solution for the monochromatic optimal power capture of heaving point absorber devices by forming a mechanical impedance matching problem between the device and the power take-off. However, his solutions are limited by device architecture complexity. In this paper, we use the mechanical circuit framework to extend Falnes' method to form and solve the impedance matching problem and calculate the optimal power capture for converter architectures of arbitrary complexity. The new technique is first applied to reprove Falnes' findings and then to assess a complex converter architecture, proposed by Korde. This work also provides insight into a master-slave relationship between the geometry and power take-off force control problems that are inherent to converter design, and it reveals a hierarchy of distinct design objectives unbeknownst to Korde for his device. Finally, we show how application of the master-slave principle leads to the reduction in the dimensionality of the associated design space.},

We develop a model formulation based on Mean-Variance portfolio theory to identify the optimal site locations for a given number of wind, wave, and ocean current turbines subject to constraints on their energy collection system and the maximum number of turbines per site location. A model relaxation is also developed to improve the computational efficiency of the optimization process, allowing the inclusion of more than 5000 candidate generation sites. The model is tested using renewable resource estimates from the coast of North Carolina, along the eastern US coast. Different combinations of technology-specific offshore technologies are compared in terms of their levelized cost of electricity and energy variability. The optimal portfolio results are then included in a capacity expansion model to derive economic targets that make the offshore portfolios cost-competitive with other generating technologies. Results of this work indicate that the integration of different offshore technologies can help to decrease the energy variability associated with marine energy resources. Furthermore, this research shows that substantial cost reductions are still necessary to realize the deployment of these technologies in the region investigated.},

	abstract = {Energy storage at all timescales, including the seasonal scale, plays a pivotal role in enabling increased penetration levels of wind and solar photovoltaic energy sources in power systems. Grid-integrated seasonal energy storage can reshape seasonal fluctuations of variable and uncertain power generation by reducing energy curtailment, replacing peak generation capacity, and providing transmission benefits. Most current literature focuses on technology cost assessments and does not characterize the potential grid benefits of seasonal storage to capture the most cost-effective solutions. We propose a model-based approach for comprehensive techno-economic assessments of grid-integrated seasonal storage. The approach has two major advantages compared to those presented in the literature. First, we do not make assumptions about the operation of the storage device, including annual cycles, asset utilization or depth of discharge. Rather, a model is used to calculate optimal storage operation profiles. Second, the model-based approach accounts for avoided power system costs, which allows us to estimate the cost effectiveness of different types of storage devices. We assess the cost competitiveness of three specific storage technologies including pumped hydro, compressed air, and hydrogen seasonal storage and explore the conditions (cost, storage duration, and efficiency) that encourage cost competitiveness for seasonal storage technologies. This study considers the Western U.S. power system with 24\% to 61\% of variable renewable power sources on an annual energy basis (up to 83.5\% of renewable energy including hydro, geothermal, and biomass power sources). Our results indicate that for the Western U.S. power system, pumped hydro and compressed air energy storage with 1 day of discharge duration are expected to be cost-competitive in the near future. In contrast, hydrogen storage with up to 1 week of discharge duration could be cost-effective in the near future if power and energy capacity capital costs are equal to or less than ∼US\$1507 kW−1 and ∼US\$1.8 kWh−1 by 2025, respectively. However, based on projected power and energy capacity capital costs for 2050, hydrogen storage with up to 2 weeks of discharge duration is expected to be cost-effective in future power systems. Moreover, storage systems with greater discharge duration could be cost-competitive in the near future if greater renewable penetration levels increase arbitrage or capacity value, significant energy capital cost reductions are achieved, or revenues from additional services and new markets—e.g., reliability and resiliency—are monetized.},

	abstract = {Marine renewable energy has considerable potential for enhancing the diversity of renewable sources, to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and combat climate change. While the technological development of wave energy converters is progressing rapidly, their environmental impacts are still largely unknown, which is a barrier that could hinder their deployment. This research contributes to the state-of-the-art by introducing a framework for quantifying and analysing the ecological risks of three technologies (oscillating water columns, oscillating wave surge converters, and wave turbines). Based on a literature review, expert consultation process, and the development of a web tool, the potential pressures and the ecosystem elements that might be affected during the life cycle of a generic wave farm (an array of wave energy converters) are investigated. The main pressures are found to be physical disturbance, physical loss, hydrological change, and noise. The ecosystem elements sustaining the largest number of pressures and, therefore, at higher ecological risk are fish and cephalopods species, and benthic and pelagic habitats. The ecological risk assessment framework is operationalized into a free-access web tool (https://aztidata.es/wec-era/) for the interactive assessment and visualisation of the pressures and ecological risks. The tool is intended to be used by managers, decision makers, scientists or promoters during the Strategic Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact Assessment of wave energy projects. The novel approach presented in this work is more sophisticated than previous risk assessment matrices, enabling to better capture the complexity of the interactions between a wave farm and the environment.},

	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1765599},
	abstract = {The relative economic competitiveness of power generation technologies is a topic of much interest to diverse electric industry participants. However, assessing competitiveness can be challenging as it requires considering both total costs and total system value of each technology, which are complicated by the (1) numerous and diverse grid services needed to operate a reliable power system; (2) variations in the economic value of the grid services with system state and location, and over multiple timescales, due to the challenges of transporting and storing electricity; and (3) the unique characteristics of different electric system assets. Ideally, metrics designed or used to convey technology competitiveness must consider these complexities, but existing metrics often fall short. For example, the levelized cost of energy does not consider the system economic value of the various technologies nor does it consider services beyond electricity production. Various other metrics have been designed with the purpose of more-accurately communicating the economic viability of electric system technologies. In this report, we summarize the primary sources and components of costs and value and review the known competitiveness metrics by presenting their definitions, applications, advantages, and disadvantages. We also introduce a new set of competitiveness metrics, which we refer to as System Profitability metrics, that more-directly applies the economic principles of return-on-investment to electric system technologies. We use conceptual examples to show how the System Profitability metrics better reflect economic viability and relative technology competitiveness compared with existing metrics. We also describe how competitiveness metrics can be quantified using optimization-based models and demonstrate this capability using a U.S. electric sector capacity expansion model.},

	abstract = {As the UK takes a step towards a greener, cleaner future aiming to be net zero by 2050, continuous development of the power network is required. A clear solution is offshore wind, having already proved its feasibility and success in nearshore sites. However, a large majority of near shore sites in the UK are already being utilised. The next step is to move into deeper waters and utilise the stronger, more consistent wind resources. A solution could be floating offshore wind which is still in its infancy, with only a few operational floating wind farms installed. Building upon the multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimisation framework (MDAO) for floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) being developed at the University of Strathclyde, called FEDORA, the aim of this work is to refine the LCoE model adopted by FEDORA, and applying it to perform the optimisation of the floating offshore OC3 SPAR. There is limited data on cost, therefore Hywind Scotland Pilot Park will be used as a basis for the LCoE model, allowing the results to be validated. This model is not restricted to SPARs, as it establishes a general methodology to calculate the life cycle cost of floating offshore wind farms. Utilising the improved cost model this work finds four optimised SPAR structures for four different maximum angles of inclination which can be experienced in the wind turbines operation. The improved cost model has a much higher accuracy, highlighting the initial cost model underestimates the cost of the SPAR structure by around half.},

	abstract = {Wind turbines are complex multidisciplinary systems that are challenging to design because of the tightly coupled interactions between different subsystems. Computational modeling attempts to resolve these couplings so we can efficiently explore new wind turbine systems early in the design process. Low-fidelity models are computationally efficient but make assumptions and simplifications that limit the accuracy of design studies, whereas high-fidelity models capture more of the actual physics but with increased computational cost. This paper details the use of multifidelity methods for optimizing wind turbine designs by using information from both low- and high-fidelity models to find an optimal solution at reduced cost. Specifically, a trust-region approach is used with a novel corrective function built from a nonlinear surrogate model. We find that for a diverse set of design problems – with examples given in rotor blade geometry design, wind turbine controller design, and wind power plant layout optimization – the multifidelity method finds the optimal design using 38 \%–58 \% of the computational cost of the high-fidelity-only optimization. The success of the multifidelity method in disparate applications suggests that it could be more broadly applied to other wind energy or otherwise generic applications.},

	abstract = {Current wave energy development initiatives assume that available designs have the potential for success through continuous learning and innovation-based cost reduction. However, this may not be the case, and potential winning technologies may have been overlooked. The scenario creation tool presented in this paper provides a structured method for the earliest stages of design in technology development. The core function of the scenario creation tool is to generate and rank scenarios of potential Wave Energy Converter (WEC) attributes and inform the user on the areas of the parameter space that are most likely to yield commercial success. This techno-economic tool uses a structured innovation approach to identify commercially attractive and technically achievable scenarios, with a scoring system based on their power performance and costs. This is done by leveraging performance and cost data from state-of-the-art wave energy converters and identifying theoretical limits to define thresholds. As a result, a list of scored solutions is obtained depending on resource level, wave energy converter hull shape, size, material, degree of freedom for power extraction, and efficiency. This scenario creation tool can be used to support private and public investors to inform strategy for future funding calls, and technology developers and researchers in identifying new avenues of innovation.},

The key to increasing the deployment of ocean energy is bringing down development and operating costs. This paper proposes a structured approach to innovation in ocean energy systems that would spur innovation and expand the market for ocean energy. This approach can be used by a wide range of stakeholders—including technology and project developers and investors—when considering creating or improving designs. The Structured Innovation design tool within the DTOceanPlus suite is one of a kind beyond the current state-of-the-art. It enables the adaptation and integration of systematic problem-solving tools based on quality function deployment (QFD), the theory of inventive thinking (TRIZ), and the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) methodologies for the ocean energy sector. In obtaining and assessing innovative concepts, the integration of TRIZ into QFD enables the designers to define the innovation problem, identifies trade-offs in the system, and, with TRIZ as a systematic inventive problem-solving methodology, generates potential design concepts for the contradicting requirements. Additionally, the FMEA is used to assess the technical risks associated with the proposed design concepts. The methodology is demonstrated using high-level functional requirements for a small array of ten tidal turbines to improve the devices layout and power cabling architecture. The Structured Innovation design tool output comprises critical functional requirements with the highest overall impact and the least organisational effort to implement, along with appropriate alternative solutions to conflicting requirements.},

	abstract = {The paper identifies and discusses the need for techno-economic performance improvements at early stages of the wave energy converter (WEC) technology development process. Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) for wave energy projects provide a valuable metric of technology readiness and deliver useful guidance for the development process. This paper describes the complementary metric of Technology Performance Levels (TPLs) characterised by a set of quantified performance criteria aimed at identifying and classifying the techno-economic performance of wave energy technology. These TPLs are broadly inversely related to cost of energy (CoE) and provide a combined measure for capital expenditure (CapEx), lifecycle operational expenditure (OpEx), energy conversion efficiency and technology availability. Less quantifiable performance aspects such as acceptability and safety are also considered in the definition of the TPLs. 
A 2-dimensional representation of technology readiness and performance levels is introduced. This TRL–TPL–Matrix visualisation provides a useful means for the evaluation, comparison and discussion of different research technology development trajectories over the technology readiness and performance levels plane. The paper identifies the need for technology performance trajectories with high technology performance levels at low readiness levels and gives valuable advice on the development strategy and tools required to achieve successful WEC technology development outcome at reduced development time, total development cost and encountered risk.},

	abstract = {Using learning curves as an analytical tool for technology forecasting involves making assumptions over a range of key uncertainties, often implicitly. In this paper, we present an explicit treatment of the key uncertainties involved in learning rates' analyses of marine energy innovation (wave and tidal stream) — technology fields attracting considerable interest, but whose commercial prospects depends on substantial learning and cost reduction. Taking a simple single factor learning rate model, we describe a range of plausible learning investments required so that marine energy technologies become cost-competitive with their ‘benchmark’ technology: offshore wind. Our analysis highlights the sensitivity of marine energy to three key parameters: the capital cost of first devices, the level of deployment before sustained cost reduction emerges, and the average rate of cost reduction with deployment (learning rate). Figures often quoted within the marine energy sector for the parameters of starting cost, learning rate, and capacity at which sustained cost reduction occurs (metrics conventionally used for learning rate analysis) can be seen to represent very attractive scenarios. The intention of this paper is to display that even small changes to input assumptions can have a dramatic effect on the overall investment required for a sector to reach parity with benchmark technologies. In the short term, reaching cost competitiveness with offshore wind is a necessity if marine energy is to reach commercialisation. Additionally, an assessment of the plausible total investment (and inherent uncertainties) in a global wave and tidal deployment scenario will be presented. The paper also considers the implications of these uncertainties for marine energy innovation management. While the benchmark against offshore wind will generally be used as a performance indicator, in order to achieve similar and sustained cost reductions to other, more mature, renewable energy technologies (and thus achieve a competitive price for marine technologies, securing their place within the energy mix), the marine energy sector needs a targeted innovation focus to fulfil the desired objectives, and a development pathway very different to offshore wind must be used.},

In this paper, we review published literature to identify major methodological challenges and key research efforts to resolve these issues with a focus on recent developments in five major areas: cross-study comparability, data availability and quality, scale-up issues, uncertainty and uncertainty communication, and assessment time. We also provide a number of recommendations for future research to support the evaluation of emerging technologies at low technology readiness levels: (a) the development of a consistent framework and reporting methods for LCA of emerging technologies; (b) the integration of other tools with LCA, such as multicriteria decision analysis, risk analysis, technoeconomic analysis; and (c) the development of a data repository for emerging materials, processes, and technologies.},

This study quantifies the environmental impacts of a 10 MW array of 28 point-absorber wave energy converters, by means of a process-based life cycle assessment (LCA). Midpoint and Cumulative Energy Demand LCA results are presented over 19 impact categories, representing impacts encompassing human health, ecosystems and resource availability. Three scenarios are undertaken to represent the use phase of the array, identified as a particularly uncertain input, with very little long-term operation of wave energy arrays available to validate assumptions. The resultant global warming potential of the array ranges from 25.1 to 46.0 gCO2e/kWh over a 95\% confidence interval, 23–43 times lower than conventional fossil fuel electricity generation. The Energy Payback Time of the array ranges between 2.6 and 5.2 years. LCA results are found to be particularly sensitive to annual energy production across all impact categories, and to assumptions associated with the frequency of marine operations over a number of categories quantifying the production of greenhouse gases. This LCA has been undertaken at an early stage in the WEC product development and will inform innovative research focused on further reducing the environmental impacts of electricity generation.},

	abstract = {Marine renewable energy has considerable potential for enhancing the diversity of renewable sources, to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and combat climate change. While the technological development of wave energy converters is progressing rapidly, their environmental impacts are still largely unknown, which is a barrier that could hinder their deployment. This research contributes to the state-of-the-art by introducing a framework for quantifying and analysing the ecological risks of three technologies (oscillating water columns, oscillating wave surge converters, and wave turbines). Based on a literature review, expert consultation process, and the development of a web tool, the potential pressures and the ecosystem elements that might be affected during the life cycle of a generic wave farm (an array of wave energy converters) are investigated. The main pressures are found to be physical disturbance, physical loss, hydrological change, and noise. The ecosystem elements sustaining the largest number of pressures and, therefore, at higher ecological risk are fish and cephalopods species, and benthic and pelagic habitats. The ecological risk assessment framework is operationalized into a free-access web tool (https://aztidata.es/wec-era/) for the interactive assessment and visualisation of the pressures and ecological risks. The tool is intended to be used by managers, decision makers, scientists or promoters during the Strategic Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact Assessment of wave energy projects. The novel approach presented in this work is more sophisticated than previous risk assessment matrices, enabling to better capture the complexity of the interactions between a wave farm and the environment.},

The motion equations of the point-absorber WEC are established according to the potential flow theory, and the wave energy capture capacity per unit is calculated. Considering it as the objective, the point-absorber WEC is modified to improve the energy-capture efficiency by using an optimization function in an approximation model. A comparison indicates that a cylindrical-bottom point-absorber WEC with a diameter of 7 m, draft of 1.8 m, and damping factor of 31 150 Ns·m−1 has the optimal performance and the maximum energy capture capacity.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. For the wave energy industry, the leap from R\&D to commercial deployment remains considerable and arises as part of the ‘wave energy paradox’, defined here as a negative reinforcement cycle involving a lack of investment, deployment, learning and returns. In this context, we review performance metrics set by funding bodies, industry standards and developers, examining how existing practices can result in sub-optimal design targets due to current specifications and misalignment of metrics between developers and external stakeholders. This paper offers initial insights - via a case study - to demonstrate how the integration of meaningful and aligned metrics throughout the design process represents a key lever in overcoming the paradox.INTRODUCTION. The vast potential of wave energy as a renewable source of power has been advocated for several decades (Isaacs \& Seymour, 1973), (Cruz, 2008). Although nearshore wave energy potential has been estimated to be in the TW range, e.g. (Gunn \& Stock-Williams, 2012), global deployed capacity as of 2017 was lagging at only 8MW (Ocean Energy Systems, 2017). Many observers argue that the shortfall is a result of the failure of wave energy converters (WECs) to converge to a single optimal design, though this can be viewed as both a cause and an effect (see following section). In 2016, O'Hagan et al. highlighted that},

This challenge is further complicated by the higher levels of uncertainty that are intrinsic to early-stage technologies. In this work, we review and synthesize published literature on the sustainability analyses of water and related technologies to present quantitative sustainable design (QSD) – a methodology to expedite and support technology RD\&D. With a shared lexicon and a structured approach, QSD facilitates interdisciplinary communication and research consistency. In introducing QSD, we review existing studies to highlight best practices and discuss them in the context of the specific steps of QSD, which include defining the problem space, establishing simulation algorithms, and characterizing system sustainability across economic, environmental, human health, and social dimensions. Next, we summarize tools for QSD execution and provide recommendations to account for uncertainty in this process. We further discuss applications of QSD in the fields of water/wastewater and beyond (e.g., renewable fuels, circular economy) in combination with uncertainty, sensitivity, and scenario analyses to generate the desired types of insight. Finally, we identify future research needs for sustainability analyses to advance technology RD\&D. Ultimately, QSD can be used to elucidate the complex and intertwined connections among design decisions, technology characteristics, contextual factors, and sustainability indicators, thereby supporting transparent, consistent, and agile RD\&D.},

	abstract = {For sustainable design, technology developers need to consider not only technical and economic aspects but also potential environmental impacts while developing new technologies. Techno economic analysis (TEA) evaluates the technical performance and economic feasibility of a technology. Life cycle assessment (LCA) evaluates the potential environmental impacts associated with a product system throughout its life cycle from raw material extraction to disposal. Generally, TEA and LCA performed separately for technology assessment. Understanding of the trade-off between economic and environmental performance is crucial for sustainable process design, which is not fully available if TEA and LCA is performed separately. In contrast, integration of TEA and LCA enables systematic analysis of the relationships between technical, economic, and environmental performance and provides more information to technology developers for trade-off analysis. Integrated TEA-LCA tool can also reduce inconsistency between system boundaries, functional units, and assumptions that can arise from using standalone TEA and LCA findings in decision making. There is also growing interest of prospective application of integrated TEA-LCA tool to evaluate emerging technologies at early technology readiness level (TRL). Integration of TEA and LCA is still an evolving area and requires further exploration to develop a consistent methodological guideline. The goal of this study is to review the current state-of-the-art in TEA and LCA to identify the methodological challenges of TEA-LCA integration approaches. This study also identifies major challenges to perform integrated TEA-LCA analysis of emerging technologies at low TRLs. Lack of consistent methodological guidelines and compatible software tools, inconsistent system boundary and functional unit selection, limited data availability and uncertainty are key methodological challenges for integration of LCA and TEA. Future research should focus on developing integrated TEA-LCA tool, formulating approach to incorporate optimization method with integrated TEA-LCA tool, and developing strategy of proper communication of results from integrated LCA-TEA tool to broad range of stakeholders.},

	abstract = {The pursuit of sustainability has catalyzed broad investment in the research, development, and deployment (RD\&D) of innovative water, sanitation, and resource recovery technologies, yet the lack of transparent and agile methodologies to navigate the expansive landscape of technology development pathways remains a critical challenge. This challenge is further complicated by the higher levels of uncertainty that are intrinsic to early-stage technologies. In this work, we review and synthesize published literature on the sustainability analyses of water and related technologies to present quantitative sustainable design (QSD) – a methodology to expedite and support technology RD\&D. With a shared lexicon and a structured approach, QSD facilitates interdisciplinary communication and research consistency. In introducing QSD, we review existing studies to highlight best practices and discuss them in the context of the specific steps of QSD, which include defining the problem space, establishing simulation algorithms, and characterizing system sustainability across economic, environmental, human health, and social dimensions. Next, we summarize tools for QSD execution and provide recommendations to account for uncertainty in this process. We further discuss applications of QSD in the fields of water/wastewater and beyond (e.g., renewable fuels, circular economy) in combination with uncertainty, sensitivity, and scenario analyses to generate the desired types of insight. Finally, we identify future research needs for sustainability analyses to advance technology RD\&D. Ultimately, QSD can be used to elucidate the complex and intertwined connections among design decisions, technology characteristics, contextual factors, and sustainability indicators, thereby supporting transparent, consistent, and agile RD\&D.},

	abstract = {Wave energy extraction requires the conversion of the energy within the waves to drive the power take off system, often by means of a principal interface, or collector. This paper describes part of the development of a robust, systematic method of optimizing the collector shape to improve energy extraction using a genetic algorithm. The collector geometry uses a parametric description based upon bi-cubic B-spline surfaces, generated from a relatively small number of control points to reduce the dimensionality of the search space. The collector shapes that are optimized have one plane of symmetry and move in one degree of freedom (surge). Each candidate shape is assessed in a wave climate based upon data from a site in the North-East Atlantic Ocean. Three cost functions, distinguished by the severity of the penalty put on the size of the candidate collectors, and four constraint regimes, defined by two displacement and two power rating limits, are the governing influences on the twelve optimization procedures described. The selected collector shapes from each optimization run are appraised in terms of size, complexity and their performance compared to that of ‘benchmark’ box-shaped collectors.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Wave energy converters (WECs) can advance the global energy transition by producing clean power for utility grids and offshore technologies. This paper provides a multidisciplinary, dual objective optimization of the Reference Model 3 (RM3), a two-body point absorber WEC design benchmark. The simulation model employs linear hydrodynamics with force saturation and probabilistic waves. The RM3 geometry and controller parameters are optimized using sequential quadratic programming to minimize the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the coefficient of variation of power. The minimum-LCOE design produces a power variation of 205\% and an LCOE of \$0.08/kWh, a seven-fold cost reduction and 23\% lower variation from the RM3 baseline of \$0.75/kWh and 255\% variation. Parameter sensitivities show that LCOE depends more strongly on site and economic parameters than geometric or material parameters, while power variation is largely insensitive to all parameters. A Pareto trade-offbetween cost and power variation reveals different optimal designs depending on which objective is prioritized, suggesting application-specific design heuristics. Three representative optimal designs are investigated: a minimum-LCOE design for cost-sensitive operations like utility power, a minimum-variation design for cost-insensitive installations like small offshore systems, and a balanced design for intermediate applications. Power probability distributions are shown for each.},

	abstract = {As the UK takes a step towards a greener, cleaner future aiming to be net zero by 2050, continuous development of the power network is required. A clear solution is offshore wind, having already proved its feasibility and success in nearshore sites. However, a large majority of near shore sites in the UK are already being utilised. The next step is to move into deeper waters and utilise the stronger, more consistent wind resources. A solution could be floating offshore wind which is still in its infancy, with only a few operational floating wind farms installed. Building upon the multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimisation framework (MDAO) for floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) being developed at the University of Strathclyde, called FEDORA, the aim of this work is to refine the LCoE model adopted by FEDORA, and applying it to perform the optimisation of the floating offshore OC3 SPAR. There is limited data on cost, therefore Hywind Scotland Pilot Park will be used as a basis for the LCoE model, allowing the results to be validated. This model is not restricted to SPARs, as it establishes a general methodology to calculate the life cycle cost of floating offshore wind farms. Utilising the improved cost model this work finds four optimised SPAR structures for four different maximum angles of inclination which can be experienced in the wind turbines operation. The improved cost model has a much higher accuracy, highlighting the initial cost model underestimates the cost of the SPAR structure by around half.},

	abstract = {Meeting climate and air quality targets, while preserving the focus on the reliability and cost-effectiveness of energy, became a central issue for offshore wind turbine engineers. Floating offshore wind turbines, which allow harnessing the large untapped wind resources in deep waters, are highly complex and coupled systems. Subsystem-level optimisations result in suboptimal designs, implying that an integrated design approach is important. Literature saw a few attempts on multidisciplinary design analysis and optimisation of floating wind turbines, with varying results, proving the need for an efficient, and sufficiently accurate, integrated approach. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art approaches to multidisciplinary design analysis and optimisation of floating support structures. The choice of the optimisation framework architecture, support platform design variables, constraints and objective functions are investigated. The techno-economic analysis models are closely examined, focusing on the approaches to achieving the optimum accuracy–efficiency balance. It is shown that the representation of the fully coupled system within the optimisation framework requires the introduction of a more complex multidisciplinary analysis workflow. Methods to increase the efficiency of such frameworks are indicated. Non-conventional support structure configurations can be conceived through the application of more advanced parametrisation schemes, which is feasible together with design space size reduction techniques. The set of design criteria should be extended by operation and maintenance cost, and power production metrics. The main technical limitations of the frameworks adopted so far include the inability to accurately analyse a diverse range of support structure topologies in multiple design load cases within a common framework. The cost approximation models should be extended by the chosen aspects of pre-operational phases, to better explore the benefits of the floating platforms.},

Presently, there is a lack of structured design methodologies that take into account both the hydrodynamic performance, structural reliability and economic data from early development stages. Therefore, a new methodology is proposed, aiming for a viable predesign solution for avoiding major setbacks at later stages. It includes a series of steps related to the initial design definition, hydrodynamic analysis, yield strength investigation and early-stage economic assessment. For demonstration, the methodology is applied to progress a sloped motion WEC for near-shore locations. The original WEC configuration is also assessed and the novel design, which allows reducing the mass of floating elements by 70\%, is developed. It is found that: for recurrent sea states, the capture width ratio of the new design (20–40\%) is similar to the one of the original design (20–50\%), the estimated cost of the device is reduced by 28.6\% and the payback period is reduced by 2.4 years. Overall, the results obtained for the case study demonstrated the interest in the proposed methodology that can assist in the development and analysis of early-stage WEC concepts.},

	doi = {10.7488/era/213},
	abstract = {Given the large energy resource available in ocean waves, wave energy 
converters have been developed over the last decades for power extraction. 
Various concepts exist, and research eﬀorts are now focussed on reducing their 
levelised cost of energy. The device structure has been identiﬁed to have the 
highest cost reduction potential. For this reason, a number of hull geometry 
optimisation studies have been performed in recent years. In these studies, 
costs have been mostly represented through the device size or weight, and 
devices have been optimised for speciﬁc sea conditions, based generally on 
simple shapes such as spheres or cylinders. However, there is no consensus in 
the employed methodology and resulting shapes might be diﬃcult to manu 
facture or unable to survive in high energetic seas. The goal of this thesis is, 
therefore, to develop a device-agnostic methodology for geometry optimisation 
of wave energy converters, which enables the generation of improved hull shapes 
that reduce the levelised cost of electricity. An existing approach for single 
body ﬂoating point-absorbers, exhibiting some of the best practices found in 
this ﬁeld, is re-implemented and extended to improve its robustness for its 
application to diﬀerent case studies. Each of the elements composing this 
approach (how the geometry is deﬁned, the choice of objective function and 
the choice of optimisation algorithm and set-up) are then evaluated and their 
suitability is assessed through comparison to other strategies. The method is 
then applied to a range of study cases, such as to study the eﬀect of location 
and of the choice of modes-of-motion for power extraction on the optimal hull 
shape. Further extensions of the method to include manufacturability and 
reliability considerations, as well as to include the eﬀect of mass distribution 
are investigated. As a result, recommendations are formulated for the set-up of 
an early stage WEC design geometry optimisation process. Additionally, trends 
for the hull shape design are identiﬁed for the considered cases - depending 
on, location, the choice of the modes of motion for power extraction, and how 
costs are accounted for.},

	abstract = {The Power Take-Off (PTO) system is the key component of a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) that distinguishes it from a simple floating body because the uptake of the energy by the PTO system modifies the wave field surrounding the WEC. Consequently, the choice of a proper PTO model of a WEC is a key factor in the accuracy of a numerical model that serves to validate the economic impact of a wave energy project. Simultaneously, the given numerical model needs to simulate many WEC units operating in close proximity in a WEC farm, as such conglomerations are seen by the wave energy industry as the path to economic viability. A balance must therefore be struck between an accurate PTO model and the numerical cost of running it for various WEC farm configurations to test the viability of any given WEC farm project. Because hydrodynamic interaction between the WECs in a farm modifies the incoming wave field, both the power output of a WEC farm and the surface elevations in the ‘near field’ area will be affected. For certain types of WECs, namely heaving cylindrical WECs, the PTO system strongly modifies the motion of the WECs. Consequently, the choice of a PTO system affects both the power production and the surface elevations in the ‘near field’ of a WEC farm. In this paper, we investigate the effect of a PTO system for a small wave farm that we term ‘WEC array’ of 5 WECs of two types: a heaving cylindrical WEC and an Oscillating Surge Wave Energy Converter (OSWEC). These WECs are positioned in a staggered array configuration designed to extract the maximum power from the incident waves. The PTO system is modelled in WEC-Sim, a purpose-built WEC dynamics simulator. The PTO system is coupled to the open-source wave structure interaction solver NEMOH to calculate the average wave field    η    in the ‘near-field’. Using a WEC-specific novel PTO system model, the effect of a hydraulic PTO system on the WEC array power production and the near-field is compared to that of a linear PTO system. Results are given for a series of regular wave conditions for a single WEC and subsequently extended to a 5-WEC array. We demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative differences in the power and the ‘near-field’ effects between a 5-heaving cylindrical WEC array and a 5-OSWEC array. Furthermore, we show that modeling a hydraulic PTO system as a linear PTO system in the case of a heaving cylindrical WEC leads to considerable inaccuracies in the calculation of average absorbed power, but not in the near-field surface elevations. Yet, in the case of an OSWEC, a hydraulic PTO system cannot be reduced to a linear PTO coefficient without introducing substantial inaccuracies into both the array power output and the near-field effects. We discuss the implications of our results compared to previous research on WEC arrays which used simplified linear coefficients as a proxy for PTO systems.},

The WEC power matrix is computed using a frequency domain model, and the performance of the WEC is evaluated along the global coasts; the met-ocean data originated from the global reanalysis database (GOW) from Reguero et al. (2012). The performance of the WEC is evaluated using two parameters: the capture width ratio (CWR), which evaluates the efficiency of the converter at each location, and the kW/Ton (KWT) parameter, which evaluates the efficiency of the converter using “economic” terms. Tuning a converter for each location displayed a positive CWR; however, the KWT was low after WEC tuning because of the weight of the structures required to tune the converter that experiences high peak periods.},

The unique design challenges for wave energy converter design—integrating complex and uncertain technological, economic, and ecological systems, overcoming the structural challenges of ocean deployment, and dealing with complex system dynamics—have lead to a disjointed progression of research and development. There is no common design practice across the wave energy industry and there is no published synthesis of the practices that are used by developers. In this paper, we summarize the methods being employed in WEC design as well as promising methods that have yet to be applied. We contextualize these methods within an overarching design process. We present results from a survey of WEC developers to identify methods that are common in industry. From the review and survey results, we conclude that the most common methods of WEC design are iterative methods in which design parameters are defined, evaluated, and then changed based on evaluation results. This leaves a significant space for improvement of methods that help designers make better-informed decisions prior to sophisticated evaluation, and methods of using the evaluation results to make better design decisions during iteration. Despite the popularity of optimization methods in academic research, they are less common in industry development. We end this paper with a summary of the areas of WEC design in which the testing and development of new methods is necessary, and where more research is required to fully understand the influence of design decisions on WEC performance.},

	abstract = {Energy storage at all timescales, including the seasonal scale, plays a pivotal role in enabling increased penetration levels of wind and solar photovoltaic energy sources in power systems. Grid-integrated seasonal energy storage can reshape seasonal fluctuations of variable and uncertain power generation by reducing energy curtailment, replacing peak generation capacity, and providing transmission benefits. Most current literature focuses on technology cost assessments and does not characterize the potential grid benefits of seasonal storage to capture the most cost-effective solutions. We propose a model-based approach for comprehensive techno-economic assessments of grid-integrated seasonal storage. The approach has two major advantages compared to those presented in the literature. First, we do not make assumptions about the operation of the storage device, including annual cycles, asset utilization or depth of discharge. Rather, a model is used to calculate optimal storage operation profiles. Second, the model-based approach accounts for avoided power system costs, which allows us to estimate the cost effectiveness of different types of storage devices. We assess the cost competitiveness of three specific storage technologies including pumped hydro, compressed air, and hydrogen seasonal storage and explore the conditions (cost, storage duration, and efficiency) that encourage cost competitiveness for seasonal storage technologies. This study considers the Western U.S. power system with 24\% to 61\% of variable renewable power sources on an annual energy basis (up to 83.5\% of renewable energy including hydro, geothermal, and biomass power sources). Our results indicate that for the Western U.S. power system, pumped hydro and compressed air energy storage with 1 day of discharge duration are expected to be cost-competitive in the near future. In contrast, hydrogen storage with up to 1 week of discharge duration could be cost-effective in the near future if power and energy capacity capital costs are equal to or less than ∼US\$1507 kW−1 and ∼US\$1.8 kWh−1 by 2025, respectively. However, based on projected power and energy capacity capital costs for 2050, hydrogen storage with up to 2 weeks of discharge duration is expected to be cost-effective in future power systems. Moreover, storage systems with greater discharge duration could be cost-competitive in the near future if greater renewable penetration levels increase arbitrage or capacity value, significant energy capital cost reductions are achieved, or revenues from additional services and new markets—e.g., reliability and resiliency—are monetized.},

	abstract = {Global and regional trends indicate that energy demand will soon be covered by a widespread deployment of renewable energy sources. However, the weather and climate driven energy sources are characterized by a significant spatial and temporal variability. One of the commonly mentioned solutions to overcome the mismatch between demand and supply provided by renewable generation is a hybridization of two or more energy sources into a single power station (like wind-solar, solar-hydro or solar-wind-hydro). The operation of hybrid energy sources is based on the complementary nature of renewable sources. Considering the growing importance of such systems and increasing number of research activities in this area this paper presents a comprehensive review of studies which investigated, analyzed, quantified and utilized the effect of temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal complementarity between renewable energy sources. The review starts with a brief overview of available research papers, formulates detailed definition of major concepts, summarizes current research directions and ends with prospective future research activities. The review provides a chronological and spatial information with regard to the studies on the complementarity concept.},

An interesting comparison between a cylindrical submerged body and a spherical one was made in terms of the system's viscous damping and hydrodynamics. The best system parameter combinations based on the maximum output power, best resonant frequency and frequency bandwidth were identified from the outcomes of the Taguchi method and optimized to capture the maximum power to operate in the specific (Australian) sea regions where the waves' frequencies are relatively low. This paper should provide a guideline for designers to tune their parameters based on the desired performance and sea state.},

This paper provides a survey of all the architectures that have been presented in the literature so far. All architectures are explained in detail using a unified description that includes optimization problem statements, diagrams, and detailed algorithms. The diagrams show both data and process flow through the multidisciplinary system and computational elements, which facilitate the understanding of the various architectures, and how they relate to each other. A classification of the multidisciplinary design-optimization architectures based on their problem formulations and decomposition strategies is also provided, and the benefits and drawbacks of the architectures are discussed from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. For each architecture, several applications to the solution of engineering-design problems are cited. The result is a comprehensive but straightforward introduction to multidisciplinary design optimization for nonspecialists and a reference detailing all current multidisciplinary design-optimization architectures for specialists.},

In particular, desalination is a technological process characterized by high energy consumption; nevertheless, desalination represents the only practicable solution in several areas, where the availability of fresh water is limited but brackish water or seawater are present. These natural resources (energy and water) are essential for each other; energy system conversion needs water, and electrical energy is necessary for water treatment or transport. Several interesting aspects include the study of saline desalination as an answer to freshwater needs and the application of renewable energy (RE) devices to satisfy electrical energy requirement for the desalination process. A merge between renewable energy and desalination is beneficial in that it is a sustainable and challenging option for the future. This work investigates the possibility of using renewable energy sources to supply the desalination process.

	abstract = {Resolute Marine Energy, Inc. (RME) is based in Boston, MA and is developing ocean wave energy converters (WECs) to benefit remote off-grid communities in developing nations. Our two WEC technologies are based on the heaving and surging motion of a buoy on the ocean surface (the 3-D WEC) and on a bottom-mounted hinged paddle that oscillates in the full water column (the Surge WEC). Our computer models and wave tank tests have revealed conversion efficiencies as high as 31\% in random sea states for the 3-D WEC and 40\% for the Surge WEC. Our objective is to complete all the testing and prototyping of both WECs by the end of 2012. RME plans to use the Surge WEC in conjunction with a reverse osmosis seawater desalination system in order to provide fresh water to coastal communities in developing countries. The proposed system will operate completely off-grid and will represent a clean and low-cost solution to the water scarcity problem commonly faced by remote communities. The fresh water production process comprises three stages: energy extraction from waves, process water acquisition and pressure regulation, and reverse osmosis. We estimate that an array of about 25 Surge WECs can produce 0.9 million m3 of fresh water per year, which is enough to meet the water needs of about 30,000 people while eliminating about 104 thousand tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. RME has identified a municipality in South Africa as its launch customer and has the support of the South African Department of Water Affairs to develop the project. In South Africa, 1.97 million people live on the coast where wave energy is abundant and each person needs an additional 700 m3 of water per person per year to comply with United Nations Millennium Development Goals. After the first deployment, RME will expand to other remote communities in South Africa.},

The collected and interpreted information and the provided analysis are filing a gap in the area of renewable energy and energy harvesting technology based on wind and solar photovoltaics where variability has been so far underevaluated.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.euromechflu.2013.01.007},
	abstract = {A potential flow model is derived for a large flap-type oscillating wave energy converter in the open ocean. Application of Green’s integral theorem in the fluid domain yields a hypersingular integral equation for the jump in potential across the flap. The solution is found via a series expansion in terms of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and even order. Several relationships are then derived between the hydrodynamic parameters of the system. Comparison is made between the behaviour of the converter in the open ocean and in a channel. The degree of accuracy of wave tank experiments aiming at reproducing the performance of the device in the open ocean is quantified. A parametric analysis of the system is then undertaken. In particular, it is shown that increasing the flap width has the beneficial effect of broadening the bandwidth of the capture factor curve. This phenomenon can be exploited in random seas to achieve high levels of efficiency.},

	abstract = {This study presents a comprehensive review of the ocean wave technology and prospects of the wave energy penetration to cater to clean global energy demand. An ocean wave is a remarkable energy resource, but it presents a very small share in the global energy mix because of various challenges and limitations encountered to unleash its potential. This study evaluates intensively the complex barriers to the ocean energy technology deployment. The existing and prospective major wave energy projects are extensively examined to identify the learned lessons and optimise possible technological solutions to close the gap in the energy market. Furthermore, limiting and motivating factors to foster the global wave energy potential growth are deeply discussed to ignite new research directions and promising solutions. In particular, the wave energy converters as the underpinning enabling technology are fully investigated regarding their technical readiness, reliability, competitiveness and critical challenges. To complete the power equation, possible energy conversion stages, grid connection and integration issues are dealt with in a broad view of the wave energy power system. Eventually, this study aims at providing an updated ocean wave technology review and progress while introducing new research gap to fast-track contributions in the global energy mix.},

Three sources of information were used to understand current cost drivers and develop a prioritized list of potential cost‐reduction pathways: a literature review of technical work related to offshore wave activated body point absorbers, a reference device that was developed through the DOE Reference Model project, and a webinar with each of four industry device developers. Data from these information sources were aggregated and prioritized with respect to the potential impact on the lifetime levelized cost of energy, the potential for progress, the potential for success, and the confidence in success. Results indicated the four most promising cost‐reduction pathways include advanced controls, optimized structural design, improved power conversion, and optimized device profile.},

The current iterative approach to wave energy converter design leads to sub-optimal solutions. This short paper presents an open-source MATLAB toolbox for performing design optimization studies on wave energy converters where power take-off behavior and realistic constraints can be easily included. This tool incorporates an adaptable control co-design approach, in that a constrained optimal controller is used to simulate device dynamics and populate an arbitrary objective function of the user’s choosing. A brief explanation of the tool’s structure and underlying theory is presented. To demonstrate the capabilities of the tool, verify its functionality, and begin to explore some basic wave energy converter design relationships, three conceptual case studies are presented. In particular, the importance of considering (and constraining) the magnitudes of device motion and forces in design optimization is shown.},

	abstract = {Over the last few decades, control engineers have focused on developing innovative control theories and algorithms to regulate systems. These control efforts are usually at the last stage of a sequential strategy that allows engineering departments to work independently and consecutively toward the design of new products and systems. Control algorithms are usually developed at the end of that sequential process, once the mechanical, electrical, and other subsystems are completely defined. This paper discusses a different approach, named Control Co-Design (CCD). Following a concurrent engineering strategy that considers multidisciplinary subsystem interactions from the beginning of the design process, CCD applies control concepts to design the entire system and reach optimal solutions that are not achievable otherwise. This approach is a game changer for the control engineer, who will be not only the designer of advanced control algorithms but also the natural leader of the design of new products and systems. This paper describes some historic engineering breakthroughs achieved by applying CCD and explores some relevant application areas. It also presents three complementary CCD methodologies that include control-inspired paradigms, formal mathematical co-optimization techniques, and co-simulation campaigns to enhance engineering creativity and achieve radically new optimal designs.},

At a time when many countries are adopting new national approaches to water management, the United States still has no cohesive federal policy, and water-related authorities are dispersed across more than 30 agencies. Here, at last, is a vision forwhat we as a nation need to do to manage our most vital resource. In this book, leading thinkers at world-class water research institution the Pacific Institute present clear and readable analysis and recommendations for a new federal water policy to confront our national and global challenges at acritical time.What exactly is at stake? In the 21st century, pressures on water resources in the United States are growing and conflicts among water users are worsening. Communities continue to struggle to meet water quality standards and to ensure that safe drinking water is available for all. And new challengesare arising as climate change and extreme events worsen, new water quality threats materialize, and financial constraints grow. Yet the United States has not stepped up with adequate leadership to address these problems. The inability of national policymakers to safeguard our water makes the United States increasingly vulnerable to serious disruptions of something most of us take for granted: affordable, reliable, and safe water. This book provides an independent assessment of water issues and water management inthe United States, addressing emerging and persistent water challenges from the perspectives of science, public policy, environmental justice, economics, and law. With fascinating case studies and first-person accounts of what helps and hinders good water management, this is a clear-eyed look atwhat we need for a 21st century U.S. water policy.},

In this paper the complete analysis of the peak-to-peak current ripple distribution over a fundamental period is given for three-phase VSIs. In particular, peak-to-peak current ripple amplitude is analytically determined as a function of the modulation index. Minimum, maximum, and average values are also emphasized. Although the reference is made to continuous symmetric PWM, being the most simple and effective solution to minimize the current ripple, the analysis could be easily extended to either discontinuous or unsymmetrical modulation, both carrier-based and space vector PWM. The analytical developments for all the different subcases are verified by numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {This thesis explores the performance of Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) and Four-Wheel Drive (4WD) FSAE Electric racecars with regards to acceleration and regenerative braking. The benefits of a 4WD architecture are presented along with the tools for further optimization and understanding. The goal is to provide real, actionable information to teams deciding to pursue 4WD vehicles and quantify the results of difficult engineering trade-offs. Analytical bicycle models are used to discuss the effect of the Center of Gravity location on vehicle performance, and Acceleration-Velocity Phase Space (AVPS) is introduced as a useful tool for optimization. Lap-time Simulation is used to determine the regenerative braking energy available for recovery during a race for RWD and 4WD vehicles.},
